Distance

A sound design or reverb plugin that simulates high frequency attenuation through air, creating a sense of distance or spaciousness in sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet Control:` Adjusts the balance between the original signal and the plugin's effect, ranging from 0 (dry) to 100 (wet)
	+ Turning up the Dry/Wet control increases the plugin's impact on the sound

Caveats:
Not suitable for mastering or 2-buss applications due to intense coloration. Best used in creative mixing situations.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding depth and space to pads
* Enhancing the sense of distance and power in thunder effects
* Adding weight and low-end presence to basslines
* Adding size and thunder to reverb returns, rather than sends

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Dry/Wet settings to find the right balance for your sound. Use Distance in conjunction with other creative mixing tools to achieve unique sounds.
