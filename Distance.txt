Distance

Simulates high frequency attenuation through air, creating a sense of distance or spaciousness in sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet Control:` Adjusts the balance between the original signal and the plugin's effect, ranging from 0 (dry) to 100 (wet).
	+ Turning up the Dry/Wet control increases the plugin's impact on the sound.
* 
Caveats:
Not suitable for mastering or 2-buss applications due to intense coloration. Best used in creative mixing contexts.

Best Use Cases:
Use Distance on:

* Pads: Adds depth and space to ambient textures
* Thunder: Enhances the sense of distance and power in percussive effects
* Basses: Adds weight and low-end presence to basslines
* Reverb returns: Recommended over reverb sends, adds size and thunder

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Dry/Wet settings to find the right balance for your sound. Use Distance in conjunction with other creative mixing tools to achieve unique sounds.
