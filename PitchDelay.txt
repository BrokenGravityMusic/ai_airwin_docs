TapeDelay2

A tape echo plugin with a long delay time, undersampled content, and Airwindows bandpasses.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay Time:` Adjusts the length of the delay.
* `Resonance:` Tightens or loosens the bandwidth of the Airwindows bandpasses.
* `Frequency Control:` Adjusts the frequency range highlighted by the bandpasses.
* `Dry/Wet Mix:` Blends the original signal with the delayed signal, allowing for subtle echoes without gain alteration.

PitchDelay

A pitch-shifting version of TapeDelay2, with a fixed pitch shift instead of flutter.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Pitch Shift:` controls the amount of pitch shifting
    + Shifting up creates shrill, crazy sounds
    + Shifting down can drop pitch to nothing or create reverse buffer looping effects
* `Regeneration:` controls the amount of feedback and can be set to total feedback in a usable way
* `Filter (from TapeDelay2):` shapes the overall tone and resonance
* `Dry/Wet Mix:` adjusts the level of pitch-shifted sound relative to the original sound

Best Use Cases:
Use as a delay or reverb plugin for adding subtle echoes or texture to tracks. Also suitable for creating vintage sounds, strange noises, or alien monster voices.
Ideal for creating extreme and creative pitch manipulations, experimental sounds, and unique textures.
Creating strange, sorta-analogy noises without additional sounds; experimenting with pitch-shifting effects in a musical context; using as a "weird instrument" for creative sound exploration.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To get the best results from TapeDelay2: Experiment with different delay times and resonance settings to achieve desired tone shaping. Use the frequency control to emphasize specific frequencies within the bandpasses.
For PitchDelay, experiment with different pitch-shift values and regeneration settings to create unique effects; use the filter from TapeDelay2 to shape the overall tone and resonance of the pitch-shifted sound.
