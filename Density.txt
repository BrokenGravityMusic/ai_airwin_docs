Density

A saturation/antisaturation tool that can be used to reshape tones in various ways.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Stage`: Adjusts the number of stages used for bulk up tone.
	+ Range: 1-20
	+ Default value: 10
* `Saturate/Unsatrate`: Controls whether saturation or antisaturation is applied to the signal.
	+ Options: Saturate, Unsaturate, Blend
	+ Default value: Saturate
* `Gain`: Adjusts the output gain of the saturated/distorted signal.
	+ Range: -100 dB to +20 dB
	+ Default value: 0 dB
* `Highpass cutoff`: Sets the highpass frequency for the distorted signal.
	+ Range: 50 Hz to 20000 Hz
	+ Default value: 500 Hz

Caveats:
None.

Best Use Cases:
Density is ideal for reshaping tones, creating saturation/antisaturation effects, and adding articulation to murky sounds. It's also useful for producing fat, distorted tones or lean, thin tones.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different stage settings to achieve the desired level of bulk up.
* Use negative values for unsaturation to create a thinned out tone that drops back in the mix.
* Blend saturated and unsaturated signals to create unique tonal possibilities.
