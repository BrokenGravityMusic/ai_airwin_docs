Ensemble

A mono flange effect that produces a unique and quirky sound, reminiscent of a cheesy string ensemble synthesizer from the 70s.

	+ Range: 
* Pre-Sparkle: A treble boost that enhances high-frequency response.
	+ Type: Boost
* Energy: An Airwindows Energy-based setting that interacts with the sample rate, adjusting tonality and treble response accordingly.
* Unique Modulation Algorithm: This plugin uses a special algorithm for its modulation effect.
	+ Range: 
* Depth: Adjust the depth of the modulation effect to control the richness and depth of the sound.
	+ Range: 
* Spread: Control the spread of the modulation effect to create a sense of width in the sound.

Caveats:
Settings can be adjusted incorrectly, resulting in undesirable tone. Use caution when adjusting settings. Using this plugin may produce unpredictable results due to its unique design.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating distinctive pads, backgrounds, or texture-enhancing elements in music production; use Ensemble as a thickener for pads and backgrounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Pre-Sparkle and Energy settings to enhance high-frequency response and suit your sample rate. Experiment with different settings of Depth and Spread to find the right balance for your sound. Adjust tap settings to create a rich, textured sound.
