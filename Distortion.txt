Distortion

A slightly dark analog-style distortion plugin optimized for high sample rates.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Presets`: Select from various preset algorithms, such as Focus.
* `Mode`: Choose from different modes, including Mojo, Dyno, Density, Drive, and Spiral.
* `Sample Rate`: Adjust the sample rate to control the plugin's behavior:
    + At 44.1k: Averaging stage before distortion, darkening output but interfering with aliasing.
    + At higher rates (96k or 192k): More poles of simple averaging used after distortion, softening tone and increasing aliasing rejection.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
    + Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:
Warm overdrive effects in music production, especially at high sample rates. Creating distinct, softer sounds without clarity from multi-pole biquad rolloffs.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different presets and modes to achieve desired distortion characteristics. Adjust sample rate accordingly to balance tone shaping and aliasing rejection.
