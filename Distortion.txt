Distortion

A slightly dark analog-style distortion plugin optimized for high sample rates, using simple averaging filters for aliasing rejection and tone shaping.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Presets`: Select from various preset algorithms, such as Focus.
* `Mode`: Choose from different modes, including Mojo, Dyno, Density, Drive, and Spiral.
* `Sample Rate`: Adjust the sample rate to control the plugin's behavior:
	+ At 44.1k: Averaging stage before distortion, darkening output but interfering with aliasing.
	+ At higher rates (96k or 192k): More poles of simple averaging used after distortion, softening tone and increasing aliasing rejection.
* `Mix:` (not present in any explanation, however one could consider adding an option for blending the processed sound with the original)

Caveats:
• May not be suitable for sounds requiring extended high-end clarity.
• Sample rate affects the plugin's behavior and tonality.

Best Use Cases:
• Warm overdrive effects in music production.
• High-sample-rate applications where aliasing rejection is crucial.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
• Experiment with different presets and modes to achieve desired distortion characteristics.
• Adjust sample rate accordingly to balance tone shaping and aliasing rejection.
