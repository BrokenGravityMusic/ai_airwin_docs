PurestWarm

Softest-possible saturation effect that adds tone and warmth to waveforms while maintaining signal integrity.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Polarity Switch`: Choose which side of the waveform the saturation applies to.
* `Saturation Intensity` (optional): Not available in PurestWarm. The plugin is designed to maintain signal integrity with a simple switch.

Caveats:
No way to get perfect integration of bypass and affected halves, as they switch off like a push-pull power amp.
May produce an obvious effect, but one that's harmonious and doesn't get in the way.

Best Use Cases:
Adding texture to waveforms that need a little sweetening without compromising signal integrity.
Ideal for bass guitars where the string swings near the pickup, producing extra voltage on one side of the wave.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Choose the polarity that best suits your sound.
Experiment with different polarities to find the ideal balance for your specific track.
