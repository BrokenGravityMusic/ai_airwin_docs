PurestWarm

A subtle tone shaper and warmth adder that applies a softest-possible-saturation effect, polarized to apply saturation on one half of the waveform and pass through the exact bits for the other half.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Polarity Switch`: Selects which side of the waveform to apply saturation.
* `Intensity Control (0-1)`: Adjusts the amount of saturation applied to the selected polarity.

Best Use Cases:
Adding texture and warmth to waveforms that need subtle sweetening. Enhancing electric bass guitar tones by saturating the side of the waveform corresponding to the string swing near the pickup.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different polarity settings to find the optimal one for each sound. Adjust the intensity control to achieve the desired amount of saturation.
