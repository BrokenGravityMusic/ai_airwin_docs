PitchNasty

A primitive pitch shifter with time-stretch artifacts that produces a high-res immediate and punchy pitch shift or throws digital trash at audio rates.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Note Interval Control`: Adjusts note intervals in half-steps (range: -24 to +24).
	+ Stacks with Pure Pitch Bend for high/low bends.
* `Pure Pitch Bend`: Regulates a pure pitch bend, stacking with Note Interval Control.
	+ Range: -24 to +24.
* `Sample Buffer Size`: Specifies the buffer size as a musical note (six octave range), affecting pitch shift capabilities and time stretching.
	+ Range: six octave notes.
* `Feedback`: Regenerates sound at high levels, creating Eventide-like noises or adding harmonic density.
	+ Can produce harsh sounds if not used carefully.
* `Dry/Wet`: Balances original sound with processed sound.

Caveats:
High sample buffer sizes can make pitch shifting impossible, while low settings may barely affect the sound. Feedback can be cranked to create constant regeneration, producing Eventide-like noises.

Best Use Cases:

* Time stretching and re-pitching source sounds to create unique textures.
* Adding intensity, punchiness, or retro tone to individual tracks or mixes.
* Creating complex, harmonic-dense soundscapes with feedback.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For high-res pitch shifting, use a moderate Sample Buffer Size (e.g., C3-C5) and minimal Feedback. To achieve 80s composite sounds, experiment with lower Sample Buffer Sizes (e.g., E2-E4), higher Feedback levels, and careful Dry/Wet balancing.
