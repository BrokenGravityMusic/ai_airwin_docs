PitchNasty


A primitive pitch shifter with time-stretch artifacts that produces a high-res immediate and punchy pitch shift, often accompanied by nasty sample-glitches.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Note Interval Control`: Adjusts note intervals in half-steps (range: -24 to +24).
    + Range: six octave range
    + Type: sets the pitch shift
* `Pure Pitch Bend Control`: Pure pitch bend control (stacks with Note Interval Control for high/low bends, range: -24 to +24).
    + Range: six octave range
    + Type: sets a pure pitch bend
* `Sample Buffer Size Control`: Specifies the buffer size as a musical note (six octave range), affecting pitch shift capabilities.
    + Range: six octave range
    + Type: sets the buffer size
* `Feedback Control`: Regenerates sound at high levels, creating Eventide-like noises or adding harmonic density.
    + Range: variable
    + Type: adds regenerative feedback
* `Dry/Wet Control`: Balances original sound with processed sound (range: 0% to 100%).
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: blends the processed sound with the original


Best Use Cases:

* Thickening drum tracks by applying a 30% layer of pitch up (or down) with feedback.
* Creating a retro tone with punchy and direct results.
* Adding harmonic density or complexity to existing sounds using the feedback control.


Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with high sample buffer sizes to achieve unusual pitch shifting effects.
* Use feedback to create interesting noises or add depth to your sound.
* Balance the Dry/Wet control to find the perfect blend between the original and processed sound.
