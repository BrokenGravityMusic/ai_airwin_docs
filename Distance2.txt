Distance2

A versatile space shaper for creating depth and adding distance to sounds.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet`: Blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Atmosphere`: Adjusts high frequency attenuation, can be used to create a sense of distance or extreme loudness.
	+ Low settings (0.1 or less): Equivalent to a natural distance sound.
	+ High settings: Extreme loudness and distortion.
* `Darken`: Controls low-frequency dynamics, helps to create a realistic sound when combined with high Atmosphere settings.

Caveats:
Using extreme Atmosphere settings can result in unnatural, distorted sounds. The plugin is not suitable for mastering or 2-buss applications due to its intensely colored nature.

Best Use Cases:
Use Distance2 on individual tracks (e.g., drums, guitars) to create a sense of distance and atmosphere. It's also effective when used on reverb returns to add size and thunder to the output.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with low Atmosphere settings (0.1 or less) for a more natural sound. Adjust Darken in conjunction with Atmosphere to achieve realistic distance effects. Use dry/wet balance to control the amount of processed signal blended with the original input. Experiment with extreme settings to create unique, distorted sounds.
