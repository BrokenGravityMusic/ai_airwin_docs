Distance2

A versatile space shaper for creating depth and adding distance to sounds.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet`: Blend of original signal with processed signal.
* `Atmosphere`: High frequency attenuation, can be used to create a sense of distance or extreme loudness.
    + Range: 0.1% to 100%
    + Low settings (0.1 or less): Equivalent to a natural sound
    + High settings: Can produce an unnatural, extreme loudness sound due to slew clipping
* `Darken`: Controls low-frequency dynamics, helps to create a realistic sound when combined with high Atmosphere settings.
    + Range:

Caveats:
Using extreme settings can result in unnatural, distorted sounds. The plugin is not suitable for mastering or 2-buss applications due to its intensely colored nature.

Best Use Cases:
* Adding depth and distance to sounds, especially drums or guitars.
* Creating unique distortion voices or textures.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with low Atmosphere settings (0.1 or less) for a more natural sound. Adjust the Darken control to balance the sound and avoid excessive low-frequency distortion. Use small amounts of dry signal to mask distortion when extreme Distance2 settings are applied.
