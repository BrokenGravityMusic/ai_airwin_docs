Vibrato

A plugin that provides a wide range of time modulation effects, including vibrato, chorus, flange, and FM-like noises.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Main Vibrato Control:
	+ Speed: Adjusts the speed of the main vibrato effect.
	+ Depth: Sets the amount of vibrato applied to the audio signal.
	+ Inverse Mode: Reverses the direction of the vibrato or flange effect.
* FM Vibrato Control:
	+ Speed: Controls the speed of the FM modulation.
	+ Depth: Adjusts the amount of FM modulation applied to the main vibrato.

Caveats:

* High-speed settings can produce aliasing artifacts.
* Deep FM settings can introduce metallic tones that may not be desirable in all situations.

Best Use Cases:

* Lush chorusing effects at moderate speeds and depths.
* Warbly or wobbly effects for adding texture to audio signals.
* Thin, airy effects by using inverse mode and low depth settings.
* Interesting overtones and resonances with full-wet FM modulation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Automate the speed control to create dynamic, moving vibrato effects.
* Use subtle amounts of FM modulation to add subtle interest to main vibrato or flange sounds.
* For lush choruses, use a balance of depth and dry/wet controls.
* To thin out audio in an airy way, set the inverse-zone control near 0.5 for maximum effect.
* For metallic qualities, combine FM vibrato with main vibrato at high speeds.
