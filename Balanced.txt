Teenage Engineering TX-6 digital mixer


A digital mixer that can replace some multichannel converters and capture high-quality audio into a DAW at 48k and 32-bit resolution.


Key Controls and Settings:

*   `Inputs`: Although it's a digital mixer with stereo inputs, its capabilities extend beyond simple mixing.
*   `Outputs`: Can handle hot sources like APIs or Lavrys without clipping gracefully.
*   `Airwindows Balanced Software`: Allows users to convert balanced professional XLR outputs into mono channels with all the benefits of balanced operation.
*   `Xvive P1 phantom power box`: Provides battery-powered 48V phantom power for high-headroom condenser mics, making it perfect for recording loud sources without overloading the inputs.


Caveats:
 
This setup may not offer 96k capability like more expensive options like APIs or Lavrys.

*   `Budget-friendly option for recording`: This setup offers a cost-effective way to achieve high-quality recordings without breaking the bank or requiring professional-grade equipment.
