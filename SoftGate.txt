SoftGate

A gate plugin that mutes hiss and smooths sample tails, allowing for a gradual fade into silence.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Fade Time`: Adjust the speed at which the noise floor is faded into darkness.
	+ Range: 0-10 seconds
	+ Type: Time control
* `Gate Level`: Sets the threshold level for the gate (from -50 to 0 dB).
	+ Range: -50 dB to 0 dB
	+ Type: Gain control
* `Link Mode`: Stereo-linked mode, allowing separate left and right channel processing.
	+ Type: Mode selector

Caveats:
SoftGateMono is a mono version of the plugin, suitable for non-stereo tracks. However, using it on stereo tracks will gate each channel separately.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for sample makers to clean up noise floors and sustain samples for longer periods.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Set Fade Time to 1-3 seconds for a quick fade.
Adjust Gate Level to taste, using a lower value for noisier recordings.
Balance the processed signal with the raw signal using the bottom fader for optimal results.
