EdIsDim

Converts stereo tracks to mid/side, applies processing, and then converts back to stereo.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Mid/Side Conversion:` Converts a stereo track into mid/side (on left and right channels) and back to stereo.
	+ `Balance Mid/Side Content`: A control that balances the mid/side content for gain staging.
	+ `Gain Staging Control`: Allows for gain staging of the M/S content before converting back to stereo.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:

* Wide stereo reverb with a fresh take.
* Saturation of center and lively width using density plugins.
* Routing techniques in DAW: send L and R to separate busses, merge back to stereo bus.
* Design synth patches heavy on left with odd stereo behaviors.
