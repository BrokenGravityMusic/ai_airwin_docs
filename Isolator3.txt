Isolator3


A filter that combines low-passing and high-passing functionality on one control, with an additional band-narrower control.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Iso`: A single slider control that adjusts the crossover point between low- and high-passing frequencies. Middle position is full-range.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: Crossover frequency control
* `Band Narrower`: Adjusts the band-pass characteristics of the filter.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: Band-pass control

Caveats:

* The plugin uses two internal filters that cannot be switched, resulting in one always being "silent".
* Q control does not adjust the actual Q of the filters, but rather affects their cutoff frequencies.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating band-pass or resonance effects
* Isolating specific frequency ranges

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust Iso and Band Narrower settings in conjunction to achieve desired filter characteristics.
* Keep Q control at zero when using the plugin as a standard low- or high-pass filter.
