Isolator3

A filter that simulates an isolator effect on one knob, with band-narrowing capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Iso: Controls the crossover frequency between lowpass and highpass filters.
	+ Range: Full range to low-pass or high-pass
* Band-Narrower (BN): Narrows the bandwidth of the filters.
* Q: Adjusts the cutoff frequencies of the filters to approach each other, creating a bandpass effect or resonance.
	+ Range: 0% to infinity

Caveats:

* The plugin uses biquad filters, which can be unstable when modulated.
* Running the plugin with high Q values or rapid control changes can cause glitches and distortions.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for simulating an isolator effect on one knob, creating a bandpass effect, or adding resonance to audio signals. Suitable for use in traditional effects processing and experimental sound design scenarios.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use smooth intentional motions when adjusting the controls for traditional effects.
Experiment with rapid control changes to create unusual effects and textures.
Set Q to zero and Iso to 0.5 to restore full-range filtering.
