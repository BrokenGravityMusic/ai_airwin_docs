BassKit

Centered bass reinforcement with mono-only bass and sub augmentation.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bass Reinforcement:` Adds or subtracts low-frequency content to the dry signal, like a head bump in ToTape.
	+ Use as an addition to dry (not "wet only") for mastering and 2-buss duties.
* `Sub Output:` Adds deep subwoofer content to the mix, but requires good subwoofers or SubsOnly testing to hear effects.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified

Caveats:

* The sub output may not be audible without good subwoofers or using SubsOnly.
* This plugin uses bass and sub augmentation only as additions to dry signal, never "wet only".
* Exaggerating the controls is possible, but intended use is for adding bass and subs in a sensible, controlled way.

Best Use Cases:

Ideal for mastering and 2-buss duties where centered bass reinforcement and subs fill are desired. Ideal for adding bass and subs in a controlled way for mastering and 2-buss duties.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Use SubsOnly to test the sub output before mastering or using on full tracks.
Adjust the Bass Reinforcement control in small increments to achieve desired results.
Exaggerate the controls only if necessary, as intended use is for subtle additions.
