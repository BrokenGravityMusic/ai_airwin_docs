BassKit

A plugin for centered bass reinforcement with subs fill, designed to be clean and controllable.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bass Reinforcement:` Adds mono-only bass to the dry signal, similar to a head bump in ToTape.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: 
* `Subs Fill:` A simplified and optimized control for adding subs content to the mix.
	+ `Filters:` Rearranged from DubSub/DubCenter, deeper and more filtered.
	+ Use SubsOnly to test the sub output before mastering or using on full tracks.
* `Mix:` Not applicable, as this plugin uses bass and sub augmentation only as additions to dry signal.

Best Use Cases:
Mastering and 2-buss duties. Ideal for situations where clean and controllable bass reinforcement with subs fill is needed.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Bass Reinforcement control in small increments to achieve desired results.
Exaggerate the controls only if necessary, as intended use is for subtle additions.
