Stonefire
`Adjusts the frequency range affected by the Stone and Fire crossovers.`
Key Controls and Settings:

* `Air:` 
	+ Use like in Air3; can cut back super-highs for a natural effect or boost for a sparkly aura
	+ Custom algorithm for high sample rates
* `Fire:` 
	+ Use as an attitude knob and midrange control
	+ Boost for attention-grabbing sounds
	+ Crossover with Stone: only one can be louder
* `Stone:` 
	+ Use like the bedrock of your sound
	+ Lean on it for a heavy, sputtering foundation
	+ Cut to control unwieldy bass or add weight without adding 'bass boost'
	+ Range control adjusts tone and presentation

Best Use Cases:
Use Air like in Air3; balance Fire and Stone controls for tone shaping; dial Range control to match desired sound characteristics.
