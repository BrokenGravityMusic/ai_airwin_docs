Key Controls and Settings:

* `Air:`

	+ Custom algorithm for high sample rates
* `Fire:`
	+ Use as an attitude knob and midrange control
	+ Boost for attention-grabbing sounds
	+ Crossover with Stone: only one can be louder
* `Stone:`
	+ Use like the bedrock of your sound
	+ Lean on it for a heavy, sputtering foundation
	+ Cut to control unwieldy bass or add weight without adding 'bass boost'

Use Air like in Air3, balance Fire and Stone controls for tone shaping, dial Range control to match desired sound characteristics.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Air like in Air3, lean on Stone for a heavy, sputtering foundation, cut back super-highs or boost for sparkle in Air.
