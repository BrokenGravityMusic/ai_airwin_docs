ResEQ

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Frequency Bands`: Up to 8 parallel bands can be set up to target specific frequency ranges.
* `Resonance Width`: Adjusts the width of each resonance, from tight to broad.
* `Level`: Sets the overall level of the resonant frequencies.
* `Dry/Wet Control`: Blends the original signal with the ResEQ-enhanced signal.

Caveats:
Be cautious when using ResEQ on a mix bus, as it can drastically alter the sound. This plugin is not suitable for use on lead vocals, orchestral stems, or other prominent tracks.

Best Use Cases:
Enhance specific frequencies on secondary elements like background synths, horns, or drum overdubs. Create a "thickener" effect by applying ResEQ to guitar overdubs or other rhythmic parts. Transform a recording by isolating and removing narrow sound characteristics.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different frequency bands and resonance widths to find the desired character. Adjust the level and dry/wet control to balance the enhanced signal with the original track.
