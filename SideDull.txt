SideDull

A lowpass filter on just the side channel, narrowing highs and centering mids.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Setting`: Adjusts the frequency cutoff for the lowpass filter (DC to 22K)
	+ Adjustment: Increase or decrease the setting value to adjust the frequency cutoff
	+ Range: 0.01 to 1.00, where 1.00 is full range and 0.01 cuts at DC

* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original (not applicable in this case)

Caveats:
If you are sure you won’t be processing just top end, or center mids and up while not touching lows, don't install this plugin
This plugin is built on a time-capsule 10.6.8 system and the VST’s built on a time-capsule isolated-from-the-internet virtual Windows 7
SideDull should be used with caution, as it can create an unnatural stereo image by cutting highs in one channel

Best Use Cases:

* Narrowing highs and down to mono in a mix or mastering context
* Mono-ing high frequencies on a mix to prevent them from becoming too fatiguing
* Creating a unique stereo imaging effect by cutting highs in one channel

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the setting value based on the specific audio material and desired outcome. Start with a low setting value (0.01) and increase it gradually to achieve the desired result.
