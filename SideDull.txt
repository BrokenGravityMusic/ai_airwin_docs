SideDull


A lowpass filter applied solely to the side channel, mono-ing highs and down.


Key Controls and Settings:

* Setting: The plugin is aware of sample rates, so if you're at a 0.1 setting at 44.1K, it ought to be doing the same thing at 0.1 at 96K.
    + Range: Adjusts the frequency cutoff for the lowpass filter (DC to 22K).
    + Type: Increase or decrease the setting value to adjust the frequency cutoff.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the setting value based on the specific audio material and desired outcome.
* Start with a low setting value (0.01) and increase it gradually to achieve the desired result.
