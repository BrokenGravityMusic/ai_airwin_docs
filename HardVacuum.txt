HardVacuum

A tube style saturation effects plugin with warmth control and Aura saturation curve, adding sparkly highs and hot searing overtones.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Warmth Control: adjusts second harmonic distortion and nonlinearity like a class A tube design.
	+ Turning up can add exaggerated effects, but be careful not to overdo it.
* Aura Control: adds sparkly highs and hot searing overtones by manipulating amplitude and angle of the audio signal.
	+ Be cautious when adjusting Aura, as it can add unwanted tones if used excessively.

Caveats:
Be careful with Warmth Control to avoid overprocessing digital audio. Overusing Warmth or Aura can lead to unwanted distortion.

Best Use Cases:
HardVacuum is ideal for adding warmth and character to vocals or instruments where a subtle saturation effect is desired. It's also useful for creating unique tone enhancements in mastering situations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with low Warmth control settings and gradually increase for a more pronounced effect. Use Aura sparingly, as it can add a lot of character to the sound quickly. Experiment with different levels to find the optimal amount of sparkle and overtones.
