VinylDither

A high-performance dither that converts digital noise to 'groove noise', mimicking the characteristics of analog vinyl records.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Error Threshold`: Sets the level at which error energy is released as burst and sparks, affecting the overall noise floor and crackling behavior.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Dither Type`: Selects between different dither algorithms to achieve the desired sonic character and characteristics (e.g., TPDF, SACD).
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]

Caveats:

* May introduce unpredictable high-frequency overreaction if driven too hard.
* Not suitable for applications requiring a featureless noise floor, as it produces a crackly, surface-noise-like sound.
* High-Frequency Overreaction: VinylDither may produce loud crackling noises at high frequencies if driven too hard.

Best Use Cases:

* Ideal for analogophile productions or mixing where a subtle vinyl feel is desired. Can be combined with other effects to create unique sonic characteristics.
* Adding a subtle 'vinyl' feel to digital recordings, emulating the sound of analog tape or vinyl records, creating a warm, nostalgic sound for music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the Error Threshold setting to balance the noise floor and crackling behavior according to the mix's needs.
* Combine VinylDither with other plugins, such as elliptical EQ or groove wear emulation, for added vinyl-like characteristics. Start with default settings and adjust Depth and Frequency Response to taste.
