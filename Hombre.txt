Hombre

A plugin that adds atmosphere and texture to audio signals using very short delays.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay 1:` First delay tap with adjustable length (0-50ms) and mix level.
	+ Range: 0-50ms
	+ Type: Delay
* `Delay 2:` Second delay tap with adjustable length (0-50ms) and mix level, calibrated to work in conjunction with Delay 1 for optimal texture thickening.
	+ Range: 0-50ms
	+ Type: Delay
* `Blend:` Controls the balance between the dry signal and the delayed signals from both taps.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Mix control

Caveats:

* Improper calibration of the two delay taps can lead to reinforcement or cancellation of low-end frequencies, affecting the overall texture of the sound.
* Using Hombre with long delay times can result in muddy or unclear audio.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding depth and complexity to dry guitars, basses, or vocals.
* Thickening the texture of acoustic instruments without altering their tone or sustain.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with a short delay length (10-20ms) for Delay 1 and adjust according to taste.
* Calibrate the second delay tap (Delay 2) to be slightly longer than the first, and adjust the blend control to balance the desired amount of texture addition.
* Experiment with different delay times and phase settings to achieve desired textures.
