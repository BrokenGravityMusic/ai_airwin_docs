Hombre

Key Controls and Settings:

* Delay 1 and Delay 2: Two calibrated delay taps that can be tweaked to thicken and diffuse tones.
    + Delay Time: Adjust the time between the two delays to achieve desired texture and thickness.
    + Phase: Flip the phase of one or both delays to cancel or reinforce low frequencies.
    + Range: Select which frequency range to reflect (highs, lows, full-range).
    + Strength: Adjust the level of the delayed signal to add punch and juice to the dry signal.
* Mix: Blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
    + Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Using Hombre with long delay times can result in muddy or unclear audio. Combining Hombre with other plugins that affect low frequencies can lead to phase issues.

Best Use Cases:
Adding atmosphere and texture to dry guitar or vocal signals. Creating a unique, punchy sound for mix elements. Enhancing the tone of acoustic instruments without adding sustain.
