Console5DarkCh

Plugin that gives a richer, warmer sound with advanced math operations for undistortion and added signal purity

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Channel/Bus Gain:` [Adjust the gain of individual channels or buses]
	+ Range: -3 dB to +3 dB
	+ Type: Default setting is 0 dB
* `Slew Factor:` [Control the amount of glue and solidness added to the mix]
	+ Range: Warmth (high), Mid-range, Cool (low)
* `Amplitude Factor:` [Adjust the level of undistortion applied to individual tracks]
	+ Range: -3 dB to +3 dB
* `Console5Channel:` 
	+ CPU cost: Higher than previous Consoles
	+ Math operations: More advanced but may not be significantly different
* `Console5Buss:` 
	+ Slew factor handling: Applies a similar behavior, but backwards to the amplitude factor
	+ Gain stage: Ideally +3 dB or less to avoid clipping

Caveats:

* Console5DarkCh may introduce DC offset from sawtooth waveforms due to its interaction with slew rate handling.
* Using Console5Buss on the master bus can help encode mixes slightly better, as superhigh frequencies are restricted.

Best Use Cases:
* Mixes that require a warmer and more solid sound
* Buses and submixes where individual tracks need undistortion
* Mastering chains where Console5DarkCh can add glue and depth to the mix

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Frame a mix with Console5 in place and adjust settings as needed.
* Keep unity gain between Channel and Bus plugins for optimal performance.
