A steep low-pass filter at 20K Hz (five poles, 10th order Butterworth), used to remove aliasing frequencies in digital mixes.

Caveats:
May make the mix sound slightly "slick" or "processed". Will not work with sample rates below 96K Hz.

Best Use Cases:
To remove aliasing frequencies in digital mixes, especially when working at high sample rates (96K Hz or 192K Hz). To smooth out and "un-digitalize" heavily processed audio. To clean up Console's nonlinearities and prevent aliasing problems.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Place the plugin before any nonlinear processing to remove aliasing frequencies. Use the plugin on every channel in a mix for maximum effect. Adjust other plugins accordingly to compensate for the "slick" or "processed" sound.
