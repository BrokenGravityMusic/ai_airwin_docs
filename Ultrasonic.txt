Ultrasonic

A steep low-pass filter at 20K Hz (five poles, 10th order Butterworth), used to remove aliasing frequencies in digital mixes.

Key Controls and Settings:

* None. The plugin has no controls or settings.

Caveats:
* May make the mix sound slightly "slick" or "processed".
* Will not work with sample rates below 96K Hz.
* Should be used before any nonlinear processing to remove aliasing frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
* To remove aliasing frequencies in digital mixes, especially when working at high sample rates (96K Hz or 192K Hz).
* To smooth out and "un-digitalize" heavily processed audio.
* To clean up Console's nonlinearities and prevent aliasing problems.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Place the plugin before any nonlinear processing to remove aliasing frequencies.
* Use the plugin on every channel in a mix for maximum effect.
* Adjust other plugins accordingly to compensate for the "slick" or "processed" sound, and consider using it judiciously to avoid over-smoothing the mix.
