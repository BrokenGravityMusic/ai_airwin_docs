Discontinuity

A plugin that models air distortion under intense loudness, adding crackles and distortion to sounds in a way that simulates real-world conditions.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Loudness Setting:` Adjusts the loudness at which the air distortion is applied (range 70 dB - 140 dB).
    + Type: Adjustment of loudness
* `Air Pressure Setting:` Adjusts the pressure of the air, affecting the intensity of the crackles and distortion (range 0% - 100%).
    + Range: 0-100%
    + Type: Adjustment of pressure
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original.

Caveats:
The plugin introduces latency due to its frequency modulation using sample buffers.
It's not suitable for applications where phase coherence is required.

Best Use Cases:
Adding air distortion to loud sounds in a mix.
Simulating real-world conditions on minimally miked instruments or submixes.
Enhancing the sound of distinct sounds that don't require perfect phase alignment.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Set the Loudness Setting to match the desired apparent loudness of the sound.
Experiment with different Air Pressure settings to find the optimal balance between air distortion and clarity.
