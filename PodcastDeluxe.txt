A compressor with curve-style compression and phase rotators, designed to emulate radio station processing.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Compressors: 5 curve-like compressors in series
	+ Adjust the individual compressor settings to shape the overall compression response.
* Phase Rotators: 5 phase rotators for additional processing
	+ Used to create a 'radio station style processing' effect
* ADClip-style Output Stage: for hard clipping the output

Caveats:
May not work to satisfaction due to imperfect design.
Curve-style compression does not provide "pumping and swelling" effects.

Best Use Cases:
Mixing: as a unique, processed-sounding effect
Drum Bussing: for high-impact drum busses without obvious distortion

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different compressor settings to find the desired balance of compression and distortion.
Use the phase rotators to create a balanced, radio-style processing effect.
