TexturizeMS

A hidden-noise plugin for adding mid-side sonic texture to audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bright:` Adjusts high-frequency emphasis.
	+ Turning up Bright adds more energy, while pushing too far can hyped-up high frequencies.
* `Punchy:` Controls the sound's fullness or spikiness.
	+ Softer settings produce a fuller sound, while cranking Punchy creates a choppy effect.
* `Dry/Wet:` Adjusts the blend of original and processed audio.
	+ Settings below 0.5 keep the noise entirely inaudible, allowing for a subliminal effect.

Best Use Cases:
- Add subtle texture and interest to flat or synthetic audio elements.
- Enhance the sonic quality of music by subtly blending processed noise with the original signal.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
- Tweak controls on a subliminal level (e.g., Dry/Wet around 0.2) for maximum effect.
- Experiment with different settings to find the perfect balance between texture and fidelity.
