Console simulator and EQ

Simulates a classic Quad Eight console, providing an accurate representation of its tone-shaping capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain:` Sets the gain for each channel.
	+ Range: -∞ to +20 dB
	+ Default: 0 dB
* `Bass Cut:` Shapes low-frequency response with a 3-band EQ (low, mid, high).
	+ Range: 10 Hz to 1 kHz
	+ Default: 50 Hz
* `Treble Lift:` Adjusts high-frequency response.
	+ Range: -∞ to +20 dB
	+ Default: 0 dB
* `Saturation:` Adds a warm, analog-like distortion.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Default: 0%
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Be aware that this plugin is a high-gain simulation, and excessive gain can lead to distortion. Bass Cut and Treble Lift settings may interact with each other.

Best Use Cases:
Use for mixing and mastering tasks where a classic Quad Eight console tone is desired. Suitable for rock, pop, and other genres that benefit from a warm, analog sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start by adjusting the Gain control to an optimal level. Experiment with Bass Cut and Treble Lift settings to find the perfect balance for your mix or master. Use Saturation at moderate levels (around 20-50%) to add warmth without overdistorting.
