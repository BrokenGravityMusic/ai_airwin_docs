Biquad2


A biquad filter with sweepable characteristics and a "synthy" sound.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Q:` Adjusts the peak resonance of the filter.
	+ Range: 1 to 1000
	+ Type: Resonance
* `Cutoff Frequency:` Sets the cutoff frequency of the filter.
	+ Range: Smoothed at low Q and frequencies
	+ Type: Cutoff point

Best Use Cases:
Use Biquad2 for applications where a biquad filter with sweepable characteristics is desired, but be aware of its limitations. It's ideal for situations where the Q value remains above 1 and the cutoff frequency does not require sharp changes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Keep the Q value above 1 to avoid stability issues.
* Avoid sudden changes in cutoff frequency.
* Use quieter input levels or reduced resonance can help mitigate unwanted effects.


Caveats:
The filter's performance is limited due to the nature of biquad filters, which can become unstable when changing coefficients mid-calculation. This results in glitches and twitchy behavior.


Resonance (Low/High Pass): Adjusts the resonant characteristics of the filter, applying a distortion effect to achieve an "overdriving filter effect".
