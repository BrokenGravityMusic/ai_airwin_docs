Biquad2

An adjustable biquad filter with a wide range of tonal possibilities, offering a sweepable and synthy sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Q (Resonance): Adjusts the filter's resonance, affecting its sweepability and frequency response. Range: 1 to 1000.
	+ Type: Resonance control
* Frequency: Sets the center frequency of the filter.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Frequency selection
* Slope: Selects the filter type (lowpass, highpass, or bandpass).
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Filter type selection
* Cutoff Smoothing: Controls how much the filter cutoff is smoothed at low Q and low frequencies.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Smoothing control

Caveats:

* The filter's behavior may become unstable when adjusting coefficients too frequently, leading to zipper noise or glitchy responses.
* Filter reacts slowly due to stability limitations.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating sweepable and synthy sounds in electronic music production.
* Using as a high-pass or low-pass filter for noise reduction and tone shaping.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* To avoid instability issues, use the lowest Q setting possible (Q=1) when sweeping frequencies.
* For a more natural sound, set Q to 10-20 and adjust frequency accordingly.
* Use resonance with caution, as it applies a distortion effect that works differently on low and highpass modes.
