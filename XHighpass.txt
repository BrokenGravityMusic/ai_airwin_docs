XHighpass


A digital EQ with a distorted high-pass filter, inspired by retro sampler DSP.


Key Controls and Settings:

* Frequency: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter (range: 20 Hz to 22 kHz).
	+ Type: Frequency control
* Resonance: Boosts or attenuates frequencies around the cutoff point (range: -12 dB to +24 dB).
	+ Type: Gain control
* Output Gain: Adjusts the overall output level of the plugin.
	+ Type: Level control

Caveats:
High levels of distortion can cause "zapping" noises and clipping.

Best Use Cases:
Aggressive high-pass filtering for electronic or industrial music productions.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use moderate resonance (around +6 dB) to maintain a clear high-pass response.
Adjust frequency to taste, but be mindful of the high-pass characteristics.
Keep distortion levels below 50% to avoid excessive "zapping" noises.
