XHighpass

A digital EQ with a distorted high-pass filter, inspired by retro sampler DSP.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Frequency: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter (range: 20 Hz to 22 kHz).
* Resonance: Boosts the high-pass response at the selected frequency (range: -12 dB to +24 dB).
* Distortion Amount: Adds distortion to the filtered signal, affecting the overall tone and character (range: 0% to 100%).
* Output Gain: Adjusts the overall output level of the plugin.
* Dry/Wet Mix: Balances the original signal with the filtered output.

Caveats:
High levels of distortion can cause zapping noises and clipping. High distortion settings can also cause "zapping" noises, especially when filtering low-end content.

Best Use Cases:
Aggressive high-passing for brightening up tracks or removing unwanted low-end energy. Creating aggressive high-pass filters for percussion or bass sounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use moderate resonance (around +6 dB) to maintain a clear high-pass response and keep distortion levels below 50% to avoid excessive zapping noises. Adjust the frequency to taste, but be mindful of the high-pass characteristics and start with moderate values to avoid introducing excessive tone coloration.
