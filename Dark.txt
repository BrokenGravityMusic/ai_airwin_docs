Airwindows Dark Redux

A novel audio processing plugin that analyzes the signal and predicts its trajectory, then applies dithering to maintain a smooth output.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dither:` A control for adjusting the amount of dithering applied to the signal
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `DeRez:` A control for smoothly reducing the wordlength (bit depth) of the audio signal
	+ Range: 1 to 24 bits
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:
Creating rich, analog-like soundscapes and eliminating bright digital artifacts in mixes. Also useful for creating old-school sampling effects or dark, gritty sounds.
