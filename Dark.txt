Airwindows Dark Redux


insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:


* `Dark`: Analyzes the audio signal's trajectory and suppresses high frequencies
	+ Range: Adjustable based on analysis
	+ Type: Dithering with intent
* `DeRez` (in Dark Redux): Allows smooth reduction of wordlength
	+ Range: 0-24 bits
	+ Type: Bitcrushing effect

Caveats:


* Requires Monitoring to be switched off due to 24-bit wordlength reduction using NJAD


Best Use Cases:


* Rich black silence behind mixes
* Creating old-school sampling effects or dark, gritty sounds


Tips on Optimal Settings:


* To achieve a lush bed of analog-rich sonics, use Dark Redux with DeRez control
* For smooth bitcrushing effects, adjust DeRez range to desired level
