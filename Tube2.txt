Tube2

A sophisticated tube simulator with input trim and advanced processing, designed for finishing up audio with a unique "tube" sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `TUBE control`: Adjusts the amount of distortion and saturation.
	+ Increasing this control softens and saturates distortion, while decreasing it achieves more linearity.
* `Input Trim`: Allows you to adjust the input level to 0.5 for level-matched operation or pad further if desired.

Caveats:
None specifically noted.

Best Use Cases:

* Finishing up audio with a unique "tube" sound
* Adding distortion and saturation to audio

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For level-matched operation, set input trim to 0.5.
Adjust the TUBE control to taste for amount of distortion and saturation.
Backing off the TUBE control achieves more linearity in every sense.
