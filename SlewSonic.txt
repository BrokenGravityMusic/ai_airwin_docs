SlewSonic

Combines SlewOnly with ultrasonic filtering to solo brightness.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Stack Count`: Sets the number of SlewOnly instances to stack (1-3)
* `Ultrasonic Filter Cutoff`: Sets the cutoff frequency for ultrasonic filtering (25k - 5k Hz)
* `Bright`: Fades between direct sound and one, two or three stages of SlewOnly
* `Mute`: Specifies the highest frequencies to keep

Caveats:
- Stacking multiple SlewOnly instances can result in extreme calibrated volume adjustments.
- High settings on Bright and Mute controls can lead to aliasing.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for dedicated hi-hat tracks, soloing specific frequencies like cymbals or whispers.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
- Adjust Ultrasonic Filter Cutoff to balance smoothness and aliasing resistance.
- Set Bright and Mute controls according to the desired frequency range.
