SlewSonic

A monitoring plugin that combines SlewOnly with ultrasonic filtering to solo brightness.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Stack Count`: Sets the number of SlewOnly instances to stack (1-3)
	+ Range: 1-3
	+ Type: Selectable dropdown or dial
* `Ultrasonic Filter Cutoff`: Sets the cutoff frequency for ultrasonic filtering (25k - 5k Hz)
	+ Range: 25k - 5k Hz
	+ Type: Knob or slider

Caveats:
- Stacking multiple SlewOnly instances can result in extreme calibrated volume adjustments.
- High settings on Bright and Mute controls can lead to aliasing.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for dedicated hi-hat tracks, soloing specific frequencies like cymbals or whispers.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
- Adjust Ultrasonic Filter Cutoff to balance smoothness and aliasing resistance.
- Set Bright and Stack controls according to the desired frequency range.
