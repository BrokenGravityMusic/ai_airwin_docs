AverMatrix

Simple averaging with adjustable number of taps, also functioning as an EQ and highpass filter.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Taps`: Adjust the number of input samples to average (1-10).
* `Poles`: Set the number of poles for filtering (1-10), affecting frequency response.
* `Inv/Dry/Wet`: Select mode:
    + 0: Regular averaging
    + 100: Highpass filter with inverted wet signal
    + Intermediate values: Subtle treble lift or high-frequency boost

Best Use Cases:

* Averaging for low-pass filtering and EQ
* Highpass filtering for clarity and airy-ness
* Treble lift and high-frequency boost with subtle peak control

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different tap numbers and filter settings to achieve the desired effect.
Adjust the poles setting for filtering like in the first Average as needed.
