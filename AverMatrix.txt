AverMatrix


Average audio with adjustable number of taps and filtering capabilities.


Key Controls and Settings:

* Taps: Adjust the number of input samples to average (1-10)
	+ Range: 1-10
	+ Type: Continuous variable
* Poles: Set the number of poles for filtering (1-10), affecting frequency response
	+ Range: 1-10
	+ Type: Continuous variable
* Filter Setting: Tune comb-filtery artifacts at higher Tap settings
	+ Range: Tunable
* Inv/Dry/Wet: Select mode:
	+ 0: Regular averaging
	+ 100: Highpass filter with inverted wet signal
	+ Intermediate values: Subtle treble lift or high-frequency boost


Caveats:

* Adjustments may be sample-rate dependent.
* Native averaging at high numbers of taps may introduce funny notches that can be tuned.

Best Use Cases:

* Averaging for low-pass filtering and EQ
* Highpass filtering for clarity and airy-ness
* Treble lift and high-frequency boost with subtle peak control

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different tap numbers and filter settings to achieve the desired effect.
* Adjust the poles setting for filtering as needed.
