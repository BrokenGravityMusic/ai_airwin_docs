BiquadStack

A parametric EQ plugin using stacked biquad filters to create steep Butterworth highpass or lowpass filters without resonance.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Frequency: sets the frequency for all three filters in parallel.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: linear
* Q: sets the quality factor for each filter, affects the roll-off slope.
	+ Range: 
* Boost/Nonlinearity: adds nonlinearity to the bandpass response.
	+ Range: 

Caveats:
The biquads can be fussy about extreme settings and sudden changes in slider positions. Be careful when adjusting the sliders abruptly.

Best Use Cases:
For creating steep parametric EQ bands without resonance, ideal for mixing and mastering applications. Can also be used as a highpass or lowpass filter to add nonlinearity to bandpass responses.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Q factors and frequencies to achieve the desired response. Start with gentle adjustments to the Q factors and gain settings. Use BiquadStack as a starting point for more complex parametric EQ designs, such as multi-band or SSL-style four-band configurations.
