NaturalizeDither

A deterministic dither plugin using Benford's Law calculations to produce a noise floor that hides behind reverb tails.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Benford's Law settings:` No specific controls or settings are mentioned, but note the weighting factors for '1' as the first digit (byn[0] = 1000;) and so on.
* `Sample direction control:` Truncates each sample up or down to the nearest value, then applies Benford's Law calculation.

Caveats:
Note that NaturalizeDither is meant to be used with BitShiftGain for 16-bit output, as it is currently set to run at 24 bits.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for use in any genre at any sample rate, adding no tonal color and producing a quiet noise floor that "hides" behind reverb tails.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
No specific settings are mentioned as optimal. However, the plugin's design allows it to work well with all genres and sample rates.
