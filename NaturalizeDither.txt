Deterministic dither that uses Benford Realness calculations for each sample, eroding unnatural qualities in digital audio.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Benford's Law settings:`
	+ `byn[0] = 1000;`: Weighting factor for '1' as the first digit.
	+ `byn[1] = 301;`: Weighting factor for '2' as the first digit.
	+ ... (similar settings for `byn[9]`)
* `Sample direction control:`
	+ Truncates each sample up or down to the nearest value, then applies Benford's Law calculation.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for use in any genre at any sample rate, adding no tonal color and producing a quiet noise floor that "hides" behind reverb tails.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use BitShiftGain to get 16-bit output from Naturalizedither (running at 24 bits).
