StarChild

A digital ambience/echo plugin that produces series of echo taps with irregular intervals, creating a unique delay/ambience effect in stereo.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Echo Delay` (or Duration): Adjusts the duration of the echo taps.
* `Prime Order` (or Prime Number Sequence): Sets the prime number sequence used to generate the delays.
* `Sputter` (or Rate): Controls the level of irregularity in the delay intervals.
* `Width`: Adjusts the stereo widening effect.
* `Dry Mix`: Blends the original signal with the delayed sound.

Caveats:

* Irregular echo taps can lead to unpredictable results when using with certain types of audio material.
* The unique algorithm used by StarChild's delay generation can produce unpredictable results, especially when adjusting the Prime Order setting.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating ambient or atmospheric effects in music production.
* Adding texture and interest to solo instruments or vocals.
* Experimenting with unusual delay patterns and effects.
* Creating unique digital ambience effects for sound design and music production.
* Adding a distinctive, otherworldly voice to sounds or instruments.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start by adjusting the Echo Delay (or Duration) and Sputter (or Rate) controls to achieve a desired balance between regularity and irregularity in the delays.
* Experiment with different Prime Order settings to produce unique delay sequences.
* Use the Width control to enhance or reduce the stereo widening effect.
