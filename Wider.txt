Wider

A stereo space adjuster that manipulates the mid and side channels using the Density algorithm, allowing for subtle adjustments to the shape of a stereo soundfield.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Mid Boost/Cut`: Adjusts the level of the mid channel, boosting or cutting it to affect its position in space.
    + Range: 0.1-10 dB
    + Type: Uses the Density algorithm
* `Side Boost/Cut`: Adjusts the level of the side channel, similarly affecting its position in space.
    + Range: 0.1-10 dB
    + Type: Uses the Density algorithm
* `Time Delay and Interpolation`: A small delay (down to sub-sample) applied to the least forward mid or side channel, causing a delicate roll-off and spatial adjustment.
    + Range: Sub-sample resolution

Best Use Cases:
Redesigning stereo soundfields, making tiny corrections to enhance transparency, and transforming sources in a convincing and musical way.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Wider to make small adjustments (0.1-10 dB) to achieve effective results without compromising the soundfield's naturalness. Experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance between mid and side channel levels.
