Wider

A stereo space adjuster that manipulates the mid and side channels using the Density algorithm, allowing for subtle adjustments to the shape of a stereo soundfield.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Mid Boost/Cut`: Adjusts the level of the mid channel, boosting or cutting it to affect its position in space.
	+ Uses the Density algorithm, which "fattens up" boosted levels and retains edge and definition when cut.
* `Side Boost/Cut`: Adjusts the level of the side channel, similarly affecting its position in space.
* `Time Delay and Interpolation`: A small delay (down to sub-sample) applied to the least forward mid or side channel, causing a delicate roll-off and spatial adjustment.

Caveats:

* Best used for subtle adjustments rather than extreme stereo effects.
* Not suitable for mono tracks.

Best Use Cases:
Redesigning stereo soundfields, making tiny corrections to enhance transparency, and transforming sources in a convincing and musical way.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Wider to make small adjustments (0.1-10 dB) to achieve effective results without compromising the soundfield's naturalness.
Experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance between mid and side channel levels.
