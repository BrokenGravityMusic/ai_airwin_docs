A plugin that adds weight and loudness to sounds, making them fatter and more energetic.

Key Controls and Settings:
* Curve Factor: A control that modifies the algorithm's behavior, adding complexity and character to the sound.
    + Adjusting this control affects how much fatness and energy are added to the sound.
* Input Gain: A control for increasing or decreasing the overall loudness of the sound.
    + Mojo can soak up input gain like nothing I've seen.

Caveats:
* Mojo is not a clean plugin, it thickens and fattens the sound without changing EQ.
* Pushing beyond its limits can cause wavefolding.
* Be aware that Mojo has an extreme fattening effect and may not be suitable for all types of sounds.

Best Use Cases: 
* Making drums or percussion sound more powerful
* Enhancing the low end of bass guitars
* Adding a fat and loud character to synth sounds

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different Curve Factor settings to find the right balance between fatness and energy.
* Be cautious when pushing beyond Mojo's limits, as it can cause wavefolding.
