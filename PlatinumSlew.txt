PlatinumSlew

A multistage slew clipper that alters transients of high-end frequencies while affecting subsonics and bass, producing a distinct retro sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Input:` The audio signal to be processed.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Audio input
* Rate of Change: Adjusts the rate at which slew clipping occurs. Higher values produce more pronounced effects.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: Parameter control
* Slew Setting: Controls the amount of slew clipping applied to the input signal.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Parameter control
* Transients: Adjusts transients of high-end frequencies.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Bass Response: Adjusts subsonics (bass) response.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: [insert text]

Caveats:
Cracking the Rate of Change to its maximum can cause audio bugs and energy trapping. Using PlatinumSlew as a sample and hold, especially with fast swooping, can trap energy.

Best Use Cases:
Mastering and post-processing for retro and vibey sounds. Adding unique textures and character to audio signals.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with low values for Rate of Change and Slew Setting, and gradually increase them to achieve the desired effect. Experiment with different stages and settings to find the perfect balance for your sound.
