ZRegion2

Emu e6400 style Airwindows Region filter with coefficient smoothing

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Poles`: Adjusts the number of poles in the filter.
	+ Range: Higher values create more aggressive effects, lower values produce softer effects
	+ Type: Numerical control
* Filter Stages: A series of bandpass filters used to distort audio.
	+ Range: Adjustable by changing the filter configuration
	+ Type: Numerical control
* Bandpass Frequencies: Set the frequencies for each stage to stagger the distortion effect.
	+ Range: Adjustable low and high pass frequencies to target specific frequency ranges
	+ Type: Numerical control
* Gain: Controls the overall gain of the filter.
	+ Range: Use to balance with dry signal and achieve desired tone
	+ Type: Numerical control

Mix:
A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
Range: 0% to 100%
Type: Numerical control

Caveats:
Coefficient smoothing consumes more CPU than the original ZRegion plugin.
Coefficient smoothing increases CPU usage compared to ZRegion.

Best Use Cases:

* Fixed tone settings: Use when you want a consistent sound without interpolation, or as a fixed tone setting, especially when combined with other filters.
* Automation: Employ when you intend to move the controls as part of the mix, taking advantage of coefficient smoothing for crackle-free transitions, or to create smooth control changes with minimal crackling or zipper noise.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve killer bass tones, set the first filter higher for midrange articulation, then lower for heavy bass mojo.
Set the first filter stage high for midrange articulation and the last stage low for heavy bass emphasis.
