BrightAmbience2

A plugin that generates a super ultra bright ambience space, ideal for creating a glossy atmosphere around vocals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay Tap Selection`: Selects the delay taps using a series of prime numbers.
	+ Can be used to specify a range of entries (e.g., entries 40-60) for a little ambient blur.
	+ Total 489 entries available, which can create a half-second or more delay at 96k.
* `Regeneration`: Controls the level of regeneration, ranging from clean digital slapback to fuzzy ambient slapback or sparkly atmosphere.
* `Offset`: Alternates delay taps left and right, creating a dual-mono ambience with center signals spread to the sides.

Caveats:
* Not meant to be used as a traditional reverb plugin.
* Best used on vocals, particularly lead vocals, for a star quality sound.
* Not intended for use as a traditional reverb.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing vocals with a bright, glossy atmosphere
* Creating 80s-style gated verb effects on drums
* Making dub-like ambiance using a blurry slapback effect

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Use the regeneration control to achieve a clean digital slapback or fuzzy ambiance.
* Experiment with different prime number ranges (e.g., entries 40-60) for a little ambient blur.
