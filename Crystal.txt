Crystal

A tone shaper and buss soft-clipper that applies a unique EQ behavior and saturation effect to audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Hardness: A slider that defines the onset of clipping, allowing you to control the "fatness" of the saturation effect (0-100)
    + Adjusting this control affects the tonal parameter.
* Personality: A parameter that adds dynamic behavior to the tone shaper (0-100)
    + This control allows for manipulation of the treble-restricting EQ behavior, based on brickwall filter data set.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding a unique EQ flavor and saturation effect to audio signals, particularly in buss processing. Suitable for applications where a specific tonal parameter is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Hardness settings to achieve desired levels of saturation and clipping onset. Adjust Personality to control the dynamic behavior of the tone shaper, exploring tonal colorations.
