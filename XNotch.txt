XNotch

A distorted digital EQ with a notch filter topology, combining biquad filters with distortion stages.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Notch frequency: Sets the frequency of the notch filter.
* Input drive (Nuke): Adjusts the intensity of the saturation effect.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Dry/wet control: Balances the amount of dry and processed signal.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
None mentioned.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for:
* Thickening up percussive sounds by notching out specific frequencies and adding saturation.
* Enhancing treble sparkle in drum overheads by notching out midrange and adding saturation.
* Creating a phasey effect by sweeping the notch frequency around and balancing with dry signal.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For optimal results:
* Experiment with different notch frequencies to find the desired effect.
* Gradually increase input drive (Nuke) to achieve the desired level of saturation.
* Balance the dry/wet control to maintain a clear mix.
* Use the notch filter to isolate frequencies you want to enhance or remove.
* Adjust the saturation (Nuke) to taste, taking care not to overdo it.
* Experiment with different dry/wet balances to achieve the desired effect.
