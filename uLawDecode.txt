uLawDecode

Decodes compressed audio using the u-Law algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Mode: Choose between encoding or decoding.
	+ Range: Encode/Decode
* Input Gain: Adjust input signal level (default: 0 dB).
	+ Range: -6 dB to +6 dB
	+ Type: Linear gain control
* Output Level: Set output signal level (default: 0 dB).
	+ Range: -6 dB to +6 dB
	+ Type: Linear gain control
* Sampling Rate: Select sampling rate for encoded/decoded audio (default: 8000 Hz).
	+ Range: 8 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz

Caveats:

* Encoding and decoding must be done in pairs; using one without the other may produce unpredictable results.
* u-Law compression can introduce audible artifacts.

Best Use Cases:

* Decoding compressed u-Law audio files or streams.
* Converting between different sampling rates using the paired encoder/decoder.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Ensure input gain is not too high to prevent distortion.
* Adjust output level for optimal listening volume.
* Match the sampling rate and bit depth for encoding and decoding (if applicable).
