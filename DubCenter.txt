DubCenter


A version of DubSub with mono bass reinforcement, allowing for extreme low-end enhancement without filtering the original audio or mid/side processing.


Key Controls and Settings:

* Treble Grind:
	+ Inverse/Out control: Allows subtracting as well as adding the treble distortion.
	+ Zero control: Sets the middle point of the treble distortion.
* Crossover: Determines what frequency range is sent to the bass sections.
* Bass Drive: Adjusts the gain of the main bass section.
* Bass Voicing: Controls the depth of the bass boost.
* Bass Inv/Out: Allows subtracting as well as adding the bass content.
* Sub Drive, Sub Voicing, and Sub Inv/Out:
	+ Similar to the bass section but working on an octave-divided version.

Caveats:

* Using high levels of Treble Grind can introduce distortion and unwanted frequencies.
* Improper crossover settings can cause phase issues in the bass section.
* Overdriving the Bass Drive or Sub Drive can lead to excessive energy and potential clipping.
* Incorrect use of Bass Inv/Out or Sub Inv/Out can result in cancelling out desired low-end content.

Best Use Cases:

* Sound reinforcement
* Vinyl mastering

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Set the crossover low to track bass better.
* Adjust Bass Drive and Bass Voicing to achieve the desired level of low-end enhancement.
* Use the Sub section sparingly, as it can produce undesirable results if not fed a clean signal.
