A plugin that mimics the sound of a tape machine head bump, with a unique IIR filter and saturation algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Head Bump Frequency`: Set to control the frequency of the head bump notch.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: 
* `Bandpass Resonance Q`: Use the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) for optimal results in creating a consistent head bump sound like real analog tape machines.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: 
* `Stacked Bandpasses`: Adjust the resonance and Q values for the bandpasses to achieve desired tone and rejection of unwanted DC energy.
    + Note: Requires careful adjustment to avoid phase shifting and cancellation around the bandpass frequency.

Caveats:
The algorithm can be unstable, prone to growl or distortion if not controlled properly. 

Best Use Cases:
Use DubSub2 in contexts where you want to add a unique, analog tape machine-like head bump effect to your sound. This plugin is ideal for recreating the essence of Airwindows' ToTape algorithms.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve optimal results, use the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) as the bandpass resonance Q value. Experiment with different track widths and head bump frequencies to find the perfect balance for your sound.
