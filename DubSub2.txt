DubSub2

Recreates the sound of an analog tape machine head bump with a unique IIR filter and saturation algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Head Bump Frequency`: Set to control the frequency of the head bump notch.
	+ Range: any desired value (ips speed related)
	+ Type: set to desired frequency
* `Bandpass Resonance Q`: Use the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) for optimal results in creating a consistent head bump sound like real analog tape machines.
	+ Range: use the golden ratio, slightly too tight values won't work
* `Stacked Bandpasses`: Adjust the resonance and Q values for the bandpasses to achieve desired tone and rejection of unwanted DC energy.

Caveats:
The algorithm can be unstable, prone to growl or distortion if not controlled properly. Requires careful adjustment of bandpass filters to avoid phase shifting and cancellation around the bandpass frequency.
Unstable algorithm that requires control in higher frequencies to prevent distortion and DC push. Phase shifts can cause cancellation around bandpass frequency, resulting in notches.

Best Use Cases:
Use DubSub2 in contexts where you want to add a unique, analog tape machine-like head bump effect to your sound. This plugin is ideal for recreating the essence of Airwindows' ToTape algorithms.
Bass-emphasis tone shaping for music production. Adding warmth and character to audio signals.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve optimal results, use the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) as the bandpass resonance Q value. Experiment with different track widths and head bump frequencies to find the perfect balance for your sound.
Adjust the head bump frequency to match your desired track width or ips speed. Experiment with different Q values to find the best resonance for your stacked bandpasses.
