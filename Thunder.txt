Thunder

A compressor plugin that retains or exaggerates subsonic bass when driven hard.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Threshold: Adjusts the level above which compression is applied.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Level metering input
* Ratio: Sets the amount of compression applied to the signal.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Integer value
* Attack: Determines how quickly the compressor responds to changes in signal level.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Time measurement (e.g. ms)
* Release: Controls how quickly the compressor returns to its normal state after a transient has passed.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Time measurement (e.g. ms)
* Transform Factor: Adjusts the sensitivity and behavior of the compressor's subsonic bass modulation.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Sliding scale with increments

Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Requires careful monitoring of extreme lows, especially when pushing the plugin hard. Can be used as a glue compressor for gentle compression at low settings.

Best Use Cases:
Preparing music for large sound systems or audiophile playback. Adding punch and energy to mixes with subsonic bass.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with gentle compression settings for a subtle effect, and gradually increase the intensity as needed. Pay attention to the threshold setting to avoid over-compressing the signal. Experiment with different transform factor settings to find the optimal balance between subsonic bass modulation and overall compressor behavior.
