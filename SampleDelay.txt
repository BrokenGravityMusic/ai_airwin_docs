SampleDelay

A plugin that combines millisecond, sample, and subsample delay ranges to create a single delay effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Millisecond Delay: Up to 100 milliseconds of delay.
* Sample Delay: Exactly 0-10 samples of delay.
* Subsample Trim: Zero to one sample of subsample trim.
* Inverse/Dry/Wet Control: A control to adjust the dry/wet mix of the combined delay.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating a single slapback echo, comb-filter effect, or timing adjustment on multimiked setups. Useful for isolating and phase-correcting specific microphones (e.g., snare mic with overheads).

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For creating a comb-filter effect, set the delay to half-inverse and adjust the dry/wet mix accordingly. To enhance brightness and complexity, keep the spot microphone inverted and use subtle settings for the other two delays.
