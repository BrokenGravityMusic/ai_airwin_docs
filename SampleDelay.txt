SampleDelay

A plugin that combines millisecond, sample, and subsample delay ranges to create a single delay effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Millisecond Delay: Up to 100ms of delay adjustment
	+ Range: 0-100ms
	+ Type: Time-based delay
* Sample Delay: 0-10 samples of delay
	+ Range: 0-10 samples
	+ Type: Time-based delay
* Subsample Trim: Zero to one sample of subsample trim
	+ Range: 0-1 sample
	+ Type: Phase-correction and timing adjustment
* Inverse/Dry/Wet Control: Adjusts the blend between dry, inverse, and wet signals
	+ Range: Blend control for mixing processed sound with original
	+ Type: Level control

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating a single slapback echo, comb-filter effect, or timing adjustment on multimiked setups. Useful for isolating and phase-correcting specific microphones (e.g., snare mic with overheads).

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For creating a comb-filter effect, set the delay to half-inverse and adjust the dry/wet mix accordingly. To enhance brightness and complexity, keep the spot microphone inverted and use subtle settings for the other two delays.
