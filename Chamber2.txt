Chamber2

Feedforward reverb with blur delay and glitch topping capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Thick`: Control for blurriness of echo, also determines the number of delays used (0 = full-length echoes, > 0 = blur delay)
    + Adjusting this control while regenerating creates a blur effect that can be swept from direct echo to chamber reverb.
* `Size`: Delay time control
* `Regeneration`: Amount of regeneration in the reverb network

Best Use Cases:
Creating hybrid verb/echo sounds
Adding glitchy, bold effects to audio signals
Experimenting with LFOs and sample-and-hold on the 'thick' control for noise generation

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Sweep the 'thick' control higher while regenerating to blur the echo into a chamber reverb.
Use the regeneration to further blur the echo or create a full-on glitch buffer effect.
