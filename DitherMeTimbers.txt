Caveats:
This plugin is not a traditional dither, but rather a filter and noise shaper. It may not be suitable for users who prefer bright and detailed sound.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding depth and organic tone to ambient or distant sounds
* Creating warm, mellow, and natural-sounding audio for CDs
* Enhancing the sonic characteristics of vinyl records

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust latency and micro-environment size to balance the amount of rounding applied. Experiment with noise shaping and treble darkening to achieve the desired tone.
