Function Overview:
A plate reverb plugin with an all-tube sound, distinct from other plate reverbs in the k-series.

* `Internal Saturation Algorithms:` A unique saturation algorithm that contributes to the plugin's distinctive sound.
* `Reverb Matrices:` Pre-set matrices tailored to achieve the desired target sound.
	+ Range: Adjust to suit specific sound
* `Tube Circuitry:` Implemented through software coding, resulting in a distinctly different internal saturation algorithm compared to other k-plate plugins.
	+ Type: Software-based tube circuitry

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for music genres that benefit from a warm, deep plate reverb sound. Suitable for use in mixing and mastering applications where a classic plate sound is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different reverb matrices to find the best fit for your track.
Adjust the internal saturation algorithm settings to taste, but be aware that this will significantly impact the overall sound of the plugin.
