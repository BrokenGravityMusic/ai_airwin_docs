Console 5 Algorithm

no description needed

Key Controls and Settings:

* DC Suppression: A toggle switch to enable or disable gentle DC suppression (optional)
	+ Range: Off/On
	+ Type: Toggle
* Threshold: Adjusts the level at which DC correction is applied (dB)
	+ Range: -20 dB to [insert text]
	+ Type: Slider

Caveats:
Gain Structure: Should be placed after gain staging and EQ, as it is not intended to correct low-frequency imbalances caused by these processes.

Best Use Cases:
Use in situations where a transparent, console-style compression is desired. Ideal for mixing and mastering applications where gentle dynamics control is needed.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust DC suppression to taste (if enabled) to prevent unwanted tone coloration. Experiment with different threshold settings to achieve the desired compression ratio.
