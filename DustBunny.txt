DustBunny

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bunny Control:` Adjusts the level of distortion and scrunch.
	+ Range: 0-100%
	+ Default: 50%
* `Gain Trim:` Optional gain adjustment before applying DustBunny.
	+ Range: -20dB to +10dB
	+ Default: 0dB

Caveats:
Avoid using on the 2-buss or in mastering due to unpredictable results. High levels can cause jittery behavior.

Best Use Cases:
Adding unique texture and distortion to sound effects, such as in sound design for video games (e.g., DOOM soundtrack). Creating unusual plugin matrix chains for experimental soundscapes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Apply restrained levels to avoid jittery behavior. Consider adding a delay or flanger before DustBunny to pad the signal and add interest.
