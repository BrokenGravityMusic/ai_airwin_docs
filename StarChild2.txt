StarChild2

A digital ambience/echo plugin adapted to high sample rates, producing a series of echo taps not perfectly regular, with a unique delay line that won't reinforce any one frequency.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay Time:` Adjusts the duration of the echoes. Can range from short, crisp delays to stretched textures.
    + Default: 100ms
    + Range: 10ms to 1s
* `Granularity:` Controls the texture and graininess of the delay line.
    + Default: Medium
    + Range: Fine to Coarse
* `Widen:` Allows for stereo widening, expanding the soundstage.
    + Default: Off
    + Options: On or Off

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating distinctive, otherworldly sounds and textures. Suitable for ambient, experimental, and electronic music productions where a unique sound is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different delay times to achieve the desired echo effect.
Adjust granularity to control the texture and graininess of the delay line.
Use the widen feature to expand the soundstage and create a sense of space.
