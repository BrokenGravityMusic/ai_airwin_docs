kChamberAR

A plugin that simulates a tape echo into a chamber, with an aggressive and wild sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Regeneration: controls the feedback level and distortion of the echo effect
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Bass Cut: filters high frequencies to create a darker sound
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Delay Time: adjusts the delay time between echoes, which can cause pitch modulation when cranked up
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Predelay: sets the initial delay before the main echo effect kicks in
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]

Caveats:
Cranking up Regeneration or Delay Time can lead to infinite echo and CPU usage.
Keeping Predelay in the middle range is recommended for optimal performance.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating unique, aggressive soundscapes and instrument effects.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different settings to achieve a desired level of distortion and pitch modulation. Keep Regeneration and Bass Cut levels moderate to maintain a stable sound.
For minimal delay time, keep the Regeneration and Bass Cut in the middle range to avoid excessive CPU usage and wild pitch modulations.
