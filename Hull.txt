Hull

Alternate form of highpass/lowpass filter that can work as either a lowpass or highpass filter

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bright`: A dry/wet control for adjusting the balance between filtered and unfiltered audio.
	+ Hard left gives darkening, hard right subtracts output giving highpass
* `Freq`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the filter.
	+ High values increase averaging and lower cutoff frequency, which can lead to CPU-intensive processing
* `Lowpass/Highpass Mode`: A control that switches between lowpass and highpass filtering modes

Caveats:

* High Freq values can result in significant CPU usage, especially at high sample rates
* The filter produces artifacts and accentuates unwanted audio content when used for sound effects or noise reduction
* Lowpassing at very low frequencies (bass) can be particularly CPU-intensive

Best Use Cases:

* Sound effects filtering
* Creative EQing and tone shaping
* Experimental processing and noise reduction

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Bright control to balance filtered and unfiltered audio.
Experiment with Freq control to find optimal cutoff frequency for your specific use case.
Be cautious when using lowpass or highpass modes at very low frequencies, as this can lead to significant CPU usage.
