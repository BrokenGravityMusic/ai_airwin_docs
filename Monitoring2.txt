Monitoring2

An end-of-2-buss plugin that allows checking of mix in various ways, with options for 24-bit and 16-bit output.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Reference sounds: SubsOnly, SlewOnly, PeaksOnly
	+ Options also include Cans variations (4) for headphone mixing
* Mono and side checks
* Narrowed-bandwidth checks like Aurat, including one-side mono versions
* Utilities: VoiceTrick for vocal tracking without headphones
* Wordlength reducer: Dark (replaces Not Just Another Dither)

Caveats:
Wordlength reducer Dark may not be suitable for everyone's taste; creates deeper blacks in silences and darker, warmer tones.

Best Use Cases:
Checking mix balance in various frequency ranges; mixing and mastering; vocal tracking without headphones using VoiceTrick.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust reference sounds to suit specific mixing needs; experiment with different Cans variations for headphone mixing; use Dark wordlength reducer for a retro aesthetic or cassette-release sound.
