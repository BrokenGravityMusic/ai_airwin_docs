YNotLowpass

A soft and smooth to nasty, edgy texture-varying low-pass filtering plugin.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Resonant Edge`: A control that introduces a new way to internally distort filters.
	+ Lower values result in slightly asymmetrical distortion for warm analog filter sounds.
	+ Higher values produce aggressive and glitchy sounds similar to circuit bending.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
No control smoothing, which may reduce CPU usage.

Best Use Cases:
Situations where CPU efficiency is crucial (e.g., low buffer sizes in VCV Rack). Fixed filter sound generation. Achieving a 'neuro' glitchy zipper-noise sound with an aggressively unnatural tone.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Resonant Edge control to taste for desired distortion characteristics. Consider using YNotLowpass when CPU efficiency is critical or buffer sizes are small.
