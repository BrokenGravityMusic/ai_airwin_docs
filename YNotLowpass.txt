YNotLowpass

A soft and smooth to nasty, edgy texture-varying filtering plugin.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Resonant Edge`: A control that introduces a new way to internally distort filters.
	+ Lower values result in slightly asymmetrical distortion for warm analog filter sounds.
	+ Higher values produce aggressive and glitchy sounds similar to circuit bending.
	+ Default position is around 0.1 on the control.

Caveats:
No control smoothing, which may reduce CPU usage but also affect plugin performance.
May be less suitable for applications requiring precise filtering or high-smoothing due to its non-control smoothed nature.

Best Use Cases:
Situations where CPU efficiency is crucial (e.g., low buffer sizes in VCV Rack).
Fixed filter sound generation.
Achieving a 'neuro' glitchy zipper-noise sound with an aggressively unnatural tone.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Resonant Edge control to taste for desired distortion characteristics.
Consider using YNotLowpass when CPU efficiency is critical or buffer sizes are small.
Lower values produce warm analog sounds, while higher values create aggressive effects.
