BiquadOneHalf

An interleaved biquad filter that combines two second-order filters into a single stage.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Set the frequency `twice as high` as you would using Biquad
	+ Frequency range: up to 1/4 Nyquist (dependent on sampling frequency)
* Best used for filtering in bass or midrange frequencies.

Caveats:
* Can become unstable when forced close to its high-frequency limit.
* May not be suitable for high-pass filtering at very high frequencies.
* Using near its high-frequency limit can produce messy results.

Best Use Cases:
* Fixed-frequency EQs
* "Head bump" effects
* Bass and midrange tone shaping

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Keep the frequency below 1/4 Nyquist for optimal performance.
* Experiment with different frequencies to find the best results in bass or midrange.
* Remember to set the frequency twice as high as desired for Biquad-like results.
