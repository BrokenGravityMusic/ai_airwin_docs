Texturize

Adds sonic texture to sounds by introducing hidden noise.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Bright: Adjusts the effect's sensitivity to high frequencies. Turning up Bright can make the effect more aggressive and energetic.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* Punchy: Varies between a softer, fuller sound and a real spiky choppy effect. Lower settings create a smoother sound, while higher settings introduce more texture.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* Dry/Wet: Controls the balance between the original sound and the added noise. Settings of 0.5 or less are likely to keep the noise inaudible.
	+ Range: 0% to 1.0

Caveats:
To achieve the desired sonic transformation, keep adjustments subtle and within reasonable limits.

Best Use Cases:
Adding texture to sounds without making it too obvious
