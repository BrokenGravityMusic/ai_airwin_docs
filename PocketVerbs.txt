PocketVerbs

A reverb plugin with multiple rooms to switch between, including chambers, rooms, springs, a PaulStretch type effect, and a unique gating effect for reinventing drum sounds.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Reverb Type`:
	+ Chambers
	+ Rooms
	+ Springs
	+ Zarathustra (dark, distant, vast)
	+ PaulStretch-type effect
* `Feedback`: Adjusts the regeneration amount.
	+ Can do full, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 level regenerations.
	+ Sets the feedback and uses the bit shift amount nearest below the setting
* `Gating Effect`: Creates a "gated reverb" effect by cutting off regeneration at a set point.

Caveats:

* Infinite regeneration can lead to distortion, but the plugin's design prevents it from causing runaway reverb.
* Zero regeneration results in a pile of allpasses, which can be used for a "gated reverb" effect.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal scenarios for using this plugin include adding space and depth to individual tracks or submixes, creating unique drum sounds with the gating effect, and experimenting with unconventional reverberation techniques.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the feedback level regeneration to achieve the desired sound without causing distortion. Use the gating effect to add dynamic interest to drum sounds and other percussive elements.
