A powerful, broad-stroke EQ with a unique sweep technique, allowing for extreme effects and boosts.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Filter Slopes: Unusually shallow slopes for a "broad strokes" effect.
* Sweep Control: Adjusts the center point of the filters to create increasingly extreme effects.
* dB Boost/Cut: Offers up to 24dB of boost or cut, allowing for wild EQ shapes.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:

* Building a mix out of composite parts with different voicings.
* Achieving broad EQ strokes without sacrificing naturalness.
* Creating synth-like effects by cranking up the sweep control.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with sweeping the filter center points to achieve extreme effects, and crank up the boosts/cuts for 24dB of gain or reduction. Use the unique design for subtle tilt effects and broad-stroke filtering in combination with other plugins.
