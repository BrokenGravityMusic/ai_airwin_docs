A powerful, broad-stroke EQ with a unique sweep technique, allowing for extreme effects and boosts.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Slopes`: Unusually shallow slopes for a "broad strokes" effect.
* `Sweep Control`: Adjusts the center point of the filters to create increasingly extreme effects.
* `Gain:` Boosts and cuts in the 24dB range, can be adjusted by typing a value (e.g., -12dB, +6dB).
* `Filter 1-3:` Three-band EQ sections with sweepable filter center points.

Best Use Cases:

Ideal for creating composite tracks with distinct voicings, and for achieving broad EQ changes without affecting other frequency ranges.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Experiment with sweeping the filter center points to achieve extreme effects.
Use the gain controls to boost or cut frequencies within each band.
Crank up the boosts/cuts for 24dB of gain or reduction.
