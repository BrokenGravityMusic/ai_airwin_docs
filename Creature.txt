Creature

Soft slew saturator that applies a sin() function to slew clipping, creating a unique distortion-like effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Depth`: Adjusts the amount of distortion.
	+ Increasing Depth increases gain and adds more "thunder".
	+ Can become difficult to control at high settings.
* `Inv`: Inverts the signal, creating an interesting cancellation effect.
	+ Can be used in Wet mode for a monstrous overdrive with significant bass.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Sample Rate:` Influences the interaction of Creature with sample rate (scales up with square root of sample rate multiplier).

Caveats:
* Can become difficult to control at high Depth settings.
* Inv control may interact unexpectedly in certain scenarios.

Best Use Cases:
* Percussive sounds or hats
* Instruments to add a unique "grind"
* Reverb sends to enhance distant loud sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start with low Depth settings for minimal CPU usage and adjust to taste.
* Experiment with Inv control in Wet mode to create unique cancellation effects.
* Be cautious when increasing Depth, as it can become difficult to control.
