Creature

A soft slew saturator that applies an unbounded sin() function to slew clipping, stacked up like the poles of a filter.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Depth`: Adjusts the number of soft slew saturators, with up to 32 stacked at high sample rates.
    + Range: Low to moderate settings for more manageable results
    + Type: Gain control
* `Inv (Inverse)`: A control that creates an interesting cancellation effect when used in phase.
    + Range: 
    + Type: Filtering effect
* `Wet/Dry blend`: Allows adjusting the mix of processed and original audio.
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: Mix control

Caveats:
The plugin's interaction with sample rate is unusual and must be scaled up with the square root of the sample rate multiplier. It becomes increasingly difficult to control at high gain settings.

Best Use Cases:
Adding a distorted, overdriven sound with massive bass response (especially on drum rooms). Creating a unique cancellation effect by using the Inv control in Wet mode.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with low Depth settings for minimal CPU usage and adjust to taste. Experiment with the Inv control in Wet mode to create unique cancellation effects.
