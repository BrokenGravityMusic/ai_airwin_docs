ChorusEnsemble

A multi-tap mono chorus effect with a bank of chorus taps for a more complex, textured sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Tap spacing: Adjusts the distance between the chorus taps.
* Interpolation mode: Selects from various interpolation modes to affect the chorusing effect.
* Pre-sparkle level: Sets the amount of high-frequency boost before the chorusing process.
* Delay buffer size: Determines the size of the delay buffer used in the chorusing effect.

Caveats:
The plugin's behavior can be affected by setting adjustments, and may not always produce a desirable sound. Experimentation is necessary to achieve the desired result.

Best Use Cases:

Adding depth and complexity to pad sounds Creating lush backgrounds for music production

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the tap spacing to balance the amount of chorus and dry signal. Experiment with different interpolation modes to find the desired tone. Be cautious when adjusting the pre-sparkle level, as excessive boost can lead to an unnatural sound.
