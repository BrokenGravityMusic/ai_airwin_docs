Huge

A Chebyshev filter that adds harmonics to the input signal, capable of generating entirely new sine waves at harmonically related frequencies.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Boost Control:` An input trim control that sets the overall gain level.
	+ Range: 
* `Nasty (or Placebo) Control:` A setting that controls how aggressively the plugin cuts off harmonics, allowing them to go closer to aliasing when increased.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: Setting

Caveats:

* The plugin may introduce aliasing if frequencies exceed the Nyquist frequency.
* Be cautious when using loud aggressive sounds as they can result in extreme amplification.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding subtle harmonics to audio signals for a smooth and mellow saturation effect.
* Creating unique colorations by picking specific harmonics to add.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with the Boost Control set around 0.2 for unity gain.
* Adjust Nasty (or Placebo) control to taste, but be aware that it can produce unexpected results.
* When using loud aggressive sounds, proceed with caution as they may result in extreme amplification.
