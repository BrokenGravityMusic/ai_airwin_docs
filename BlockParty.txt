BlockParty

A moderately saturated analog limiter with OneCornerClip-like behaviors.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Kicked down low initially, then expands to full scale, interactive with audio input.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Determining compression level
* `Gain`: Offers a lot of gain for peak limiting or slamming into effect.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Peak limiting or heavy compression
* `Dry/Wet`: Blends between original (dry) and compressed (wet) output. Turning off can be used to introduce raw digital clipping.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original

Caveats:
No lookahead or tone preservation.
Threshold is unstable due to interaction with audio input.

Best Use Cases:
Peak limiting and loudness maximizing
Smashing drums and other sounds in a distinctive way

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use small amounts for subtle effects, or turn up the gain to achieve more aggressive compression. The clipping stage is after the dry/wet control, so adjust accordingly to avoid digital clipping.
