A moderately saturated analog limiter with OneCornerClip-like behaviors.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold:` Kicked down low initially, then expands to full scale.
    + Range: Interactive with audio input
    + Type: Determines compression level
* `Gain:` Offers a lot of gain for peak limiting or slamming into effect.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: Allows for peak limiting or heavy compression
* `Dry/Wet:` Blends between uncompressed (dry) and compressed (wet) output.
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: Controls the amount of processed audio mixed with the original signal

Caveats:

* No lookahead or tone preservation.

Best Use Cases:

* Peak limiting for loudness maximizing (use small amounts).
* Smashing drums and other sounds in a distinctive way.
* Slamping sounds into it for effect.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use small amounts of gain for peak limiting or subtle effects. Adjust threshold and gain to balance compression levels. Experiment with dry/wet settings to control the amount of processed audio.
