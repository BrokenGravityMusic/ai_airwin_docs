Acceleration

An acceleration limiter plugin that targets and reduces edge-related digital behavior, ideal for taming brightness in source material.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Amount control: Adjusts the intensity of the effect.
* Dry/Wet control: Blend between original sound and processed sound. In this case, you're progressively adding more stages with increasing dry/wet values.
* Adjustment: Adjusts the amount of acceleration limiting applied to the signal.

Range:
	+ Amount control: Not specified
	+ Dry/Wet control: Not specified
	+ Adjustment: Not specified

Type:
	+ Amount control: Not specified
	+ Dry/Wet control: Not specified
	+ Adjustment: Not specified

Best Use Cases:

* Reducing edge-related digital behavior in source material.
* Taming brightness in ITB mixes or weird edgy sources.
* Preparing material for mastering by reducing overshoots and glare-y effects.
* Use in situations where high-end edge needs to be tamed, such as when working with noisy or digital-sounding sources.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Amount control to match your desired amount of edge reduction. Use the Dry/Wet control to find a balance between processing and retaining original sound characteristics. Adjust the Adjustment control to a moderate level (around 50-70%) and then tweak the dry/wet ratio to balance the desired amount of limiting.

Don't try and get the apparent volume of the highs to be less. Instead, aim for character or presentation improvement.
