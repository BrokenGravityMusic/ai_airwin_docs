Acceleration

An acceleration limiter plugin that targets and reduces edge-related digital behavior, ideal for taming brightness in source material.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Amount control`: Adjusts the intensity of the effect.
* `Dry/Wet control`: Blend between original sound and processed sound. In this case, you're progressively adding more stages with increasing dry/wet values.
* `Adjustment`: Adjusts the amount of acceleration limiting applied to the signal (optional).
	+ Turning up will increase the effectiveness of the limiter, while turning down will reduce its effect.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:

* Reducing edge-related digital behavior in source material.
* Taming brightness in ITB mixes or weird edgy sources.
* Preparing material for mastering by reducing overshoots and glare-y effects. (optional)
Use in situations where high-end edge needs to be tamed, such as when working with noisy or digital-sounding sources.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Amount control to match your desired amount of edge reduction. Use the Dry/Wet control to find a balance between processing and retaining original sound characteristics.
Don't try and get the apparent volume of the highs to be less. Instead, aim for character or presentation improvement.
Target the nasty digital brightness without altering basic mix balance.
