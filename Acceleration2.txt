Acceleration2

An updated high-frequency limiter that glues and tames harsh digital brightness, preventing Gibb effect overshoots and crackle, while preserving sparkle and air in recordings.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Limit`: Adjusts the intensity of the limiting effect.
	+ Small amounts: Tames edge without affecting overall brightness.
	+ Larger amounts: Can make highs soft and dull (not recommended).
* `Taming Control` (formerly Acceleration): Regulates how "hard" the limiter glues the highs.
* `Sample Rate`: Updated version works at all sample rates without issues.

Caveats:
* Excessive use can make the highs sound dull or muffled.
* Best used in small amounts to subtly tame harsh digital brightness.

Best Use Cases:
* Mastering music for vinyl cutting heads.
* Taming excessive high-frequency energy in very digital mixes.
* Preserving sparkle and air in recordings while eliminating harsh brightness.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Apply small amounts of Limit control (1-2 dB) to subtly tame edge without affecting overall brightness.
* Use the Taming Control to regulate how "hard" the limiter glues the highs, depending on the desired tone.

Avoid over-limiting, as it can make things sound soft and dull. The purpose is not to alter EQ settings, but rather to glue high frequencies together. Apply Acceleration2 as a final mastering step before EQ or other processing.
