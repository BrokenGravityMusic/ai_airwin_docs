Caveats:
Excessive use can make the highs sound dull or muffled.
Best Use Cases:
Mastering music for vinyl cutting heads, Taming excessive high-frequency energy in very digital mixes, Preserving sparkle and air in recordings while eliminating harsh brightness.
Tips on Optimal Settings:
Apply small amounts of Limit control (1-2 dB) to subtly tame edge without affecting overall brightness. Use the Taming Control to regulate how "hard" the limiter glues the highs, depending on the desired tone.
