Highpass2/Lowpass2

Variable-slope high/low pass filters with adjustable slope and tone doctoring, allowing for subtle filtering or dramatic effects.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Control` (both): Adjusts the cutoff frequency, from complete silence to wide open, varying by sample rate.
	+ Range: From complete silence to wide open
* `Poles` (0-4): Number of poles for the filter, affecting strength and roll-off.
	+ Default: 4
* `Loose/Tight slider` (Highpass2): Interacts with Filter Control to vary cutoff frequency based on input sample value.
	+ Range: Loose (less filtering) to Tight (more filtering)
* `Soft/Hard slider` (Lowpass2): Varies the cutoff based on input sample values, with "Hard" rolling off harder for peaks and letting them through more
* `Sample Rate`: Filter behavior varies by sample rate.

Caveats:

* The filter control does not stay the same across all sample rates.
* Using higher poles can cause subtle bleed-through near the Nyquist frequency.
* Highpass2 rolls off high frequencies as it gets harder, similar to Lowpass2 but in reverse.

Best Use Cases (both):

* Experimental tone shaping
* Sound design

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Pole Counts to achieve desired filtering strength.
* Adjust Filter Control and Loose/Tight/Soft/Hard slider in tandem to optimize results.
* Crank Filter Control to Hard for dramatic effects on pink noise, simulating wind noise at high speeds.
