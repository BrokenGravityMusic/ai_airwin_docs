Highpass2/Lowpass2

Variable-slope high/lowpass filters with adjustable slope and tone doctoring.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency, allowing for a fully open or heavily filtered sound regardless of sample rate.
	+ Range: From complete silence to wide open
	+ Type: Adjustable
* `Loose/Tight Slider (Highpass2):` Interacts with Filter Control to vary the cutoff based on input signal value, allowing for subtle filtering or dramatic effects.
	+ Range: Loose (less filtering) to Tight (more filtering)
* `Poles`: Selects the number of poles for filtering (0-4).
	+ Default: 4
	+ Type: Adjustable

Caveats:

* The filter control does not stay the same across all sample rates.
* Using higher poles can cause subtle bleed-through near the Nyquist frequency.

Best Use Cases:

* Experimental tone shaping
* Sound design

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Pole Counts and Filter Control settings for optimal results.
* Adjust Loose/Tight Slider and Filter Control in tandem for dramatic effects on pink noise or sound design.
