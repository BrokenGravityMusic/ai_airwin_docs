Spiral2

A plugin that adds a "Presence" effect to Spiral, allowing onset transients to pass through while preserving low-frequency dynamics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Presence:` A slider (crossfader) that blends between the original Spiral circuit and the circuit with one-sample delay on the sense circuit.
	+ 0: Original Spiral circuit
	+ Full: Circuit with one-sample delay on the sense circuit, allowing onset transients to pass through
	+ Midway: Balanced blend of both circuits, producing a peaking effect at exactly 0 dB
* `Pre and Post Gain:` Controls for adjusting the gain before and after the signal processing
* `Highpass:` A high-pass filter to remove low-frequency content
* `Dry/Wet Mix:` A control for blending the processed signal with the original dry signal

Caveats:
Using excessive Presence can introduce too much "air" or distortion in extreme cases.
Setting Presence to 0 returns the plugin to its original Spiral behavior.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal scenarios for using Spiral2 include:

* Adding presence and punchiness to low-level signals
* Preserving onset transients while maintaining dynamic range control

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Presence settings to find the desired balance between signal preservation and effect.
Adjust Pre and Post Gain to optimize the overall signal-to-noise ratio.
Use Highpass to remove unwanted low-frequency content if necessary.
