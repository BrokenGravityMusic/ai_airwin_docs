A plugin for enhancing mix clarity by targeting specific frequency ranges.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Focus: controls the bandpass filtering and distortion
    + Range: low values result in broad-based overdrive, higher values narrow the distortion band
    + Type: bandpass filter
* Output Level: sets the output level of the distorted signal
    + Range: adjustable
    + Type: gain control
* Dry/Wet: blends the original and distorted signals
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: mix control
* Distortion Algorithm: selects from five different algorithms (Density, Drive, Spiral, Mojo, Dyno)
    + Options: five distortion types

Caveats:
Focus is not an EQ; it's a tool for enhancing mix clarity by targeting specific frequency ranges. High Focus settings can result in saturated midrange tones.

Best Use Cases:
Creating clarity by distorting specific frequency ranges, improving mix balance and focus, correcting midrange issues.
