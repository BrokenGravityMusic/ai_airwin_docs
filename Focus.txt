Focus

insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Focus:` Adjusts the bandpass filter's center frequency and width
	+ Range: [not specified]
	+ Type: Frequency range control
* `Output Level:` Sets the output level of the distorted signal
	+ Range: [not specified]
	+ Type: Volume control
* `Dry/Wet:` Blends the original and distorted signals
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control
* `Distortion Algorithm:` Selects from five algorithms (Density, Drive, Spiral, Mojo, Dyno)
	+ Options: [list all options]
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
High Focus settings can produce aliasing if not monitored carefully. High Focus settings can result in saturated midrange tones.

Best Use Cases:
Adding depth and intensity to mixes, Locating specific frequencies or elements in the mix, Enhancing overall clarity and focus.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with low Focus values for a broad-based overdrive effect, Gradually increase Focus to target specific frequency ranges, Use Output Level control to prevent midrange boosting, Experiment with different distortion algorithms to find the desired tone.
