Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with moderate Drive Amount values and adjust based on the desired sound.
* Experiment with Highpass settings to find the optimal balance between brightness and distortion.
* Use Output Trim to maintain the overall level of the sound while adjusting the distortion.
* Boost Drive Level to increase distortion intensity. Increase Fracture Value to allow more frequent folding before clipping.
