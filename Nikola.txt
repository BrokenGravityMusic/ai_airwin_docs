Nikola

An audio Tesla Coil simulator that fires bolts of lightning at audio rate, simulating industrial scrunch and noise effects.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Voltage:` A control that combines two different effects:
	+ At low values (brighter): Adds airiness and a sustaining industrial scrunch effect.
	+ At high values: Produces midrangey distortion and an unpredictable effect.
* `Sample Rate:` Note: Nikola does not adapt to sample rates. It may sound different at higher sample rates (96K or 192k) and is best used at lower sample rates.

Best Use Cases:

* Sound design and experimentation, particularly when combined with other plugins like distortion and reverb.
* Mangling individual tracks in a industrial way.
* Creating convolution-style reverb effects by retrigerring the 'zap' at every zero crossing.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* To achieve the best results, turn Voltage up high and combine with distortion and reverb to create an immersive experience.
* Experiment with different settings to produce unique, unpredictable effects.
