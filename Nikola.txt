Nikola

One-line description: Audio Tesla Coil simulator with two modes

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Voltage:` A control that combines two effects:
	+ At low Voltage (e.g., 0-20%): Brighter, airier effect with little roar and sustaining industrial scrunch.
	+ At high Voltage (e.g., 80-100%): Midrangey and distorted.
	+ Range: Adjustable
	+ Type: Impulse Response Generator
* `Sample Rate:` Note: Nikola does not adapt to sample rates. It may sound different at higher sample rates (96K or 192k) and is best used at lower sample rates.
* `Output:` Can be used to mangle individual tracks in an industrial way, or as a convolution reverb by retrigerring the 'zap' at every zero crossing.

Caveats:

* Nikola's behavior can be unpredictable, especially when using high Voltage or firing off multiple impulses.
* Oversampling this plugin will not produce desirable results.
* Undersampling Nikola might yield interesting effects, but this has not been extensively tested.
* The plugin is legacy-based and does not adapt to sample rates.

Best Use Cases:

* Sound design purposes, such as creating industrial or otherworldly effects.
* Mangling individual tracks in a creative and unpredictable way.
* Creating convolution-style reverb effects by retrigerring the 'zap' at every zero crossing.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Voltage settings to find the perfect balance for your desired outcome.
* Use Nikola in conjunction with distortion and reverb plugins to enhance its sonic characteristics.
* To achieve the full Tesla Coil sound, turn Voltage up high and add distortion as needed.
