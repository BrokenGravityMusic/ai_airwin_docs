SubTight

A variation on the Creature algorithm used to tighten sub-lows.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Steepness`: A control that affects the strength of SubTight's effect. Increasing Steepness makes the plugin more aggressive in refining the low end.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Control
* `Trim`: A control that adjusts the amount of "weakness" or "flabbiness" removed from the bass.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Dry/Wet`: Not used, as this is a variation on the Creature algorithm.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control

Caveats:
* The Steep control affects the plugin's behavior in non-linear ways.
* SubTight is not a filter and does not behave like one, even when increasing Steepness makes it seem to refine the low end more aggressively.
* Increasing Steepness will continue to affect everything, not just frequencies below the crossover.

Best Use Cases:
* Tightening sub-lows for drums or bass instruments.
* Defining a "nega-zone" inside the bass and making it vanish for punchier transients.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start with low Steep settings (0.2-0.4) to achieve a balanced effect.
* Experiment with higher Steep settings to refine the low end, but be aware of the non-linear effects.
* Use Trim to adjust the amount of "weakness" removed from the bass, rather than relying on Steepness alone.
