Console7Crunch

Key Controls and Settings:

* UltrasonX filters (five instances in each signal path):
    + Two on each channel
    + Two on the submix
    + One on the 2-buss
    + Can be used as 'pre-brightening' or 'complementary darkening' ones
* Filtering order:
    + Can be adjusted to suit individual needs

Caveats:

* Requires careful calibration of resonance values to avoid unwanted frequency emphasis.
* May introduce clipping and nonlinearities when pushed to extreme levels.

Best Use Cases:

* High-gain applications in the Console7 system.
* Adding distorted punch in the extreme highs.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different filter placements (e.g., before or after distortion) to achieve desired tonal characteristics.
* Pay close attention to resonance values to maintain a flat and clear sound.
