A cascaded biquad filter with steeper roll-off before resonance, ideal for steep filter slopes without cutoff resonance.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Frequency: Adjusts the frequency of each biquad filter.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: Frequency control
* Q: Sets the Q factor (bandwidth) for each biquad filter.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: Gain/Attenuation control
* Inv/Dry/Wet: Controls the mix between the original signal and the processed signal. Note: This is a 3-band wet/dry/wet setup.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: Blend control

Caveats:
Be cautious when adjusting controls abruptly, as extreme settings may cause instability. The filters can be sensitive to specific Q factor settings and stacking configurations.

Best Use Cases:
Use BiquadTriple for steep filter slopes without resonance issues. Ideal for mocking up effects and testing filter combinations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Bleed in dry signal for a shelf-like effect when using a steep rolloff. Experiment with staggered Q factors to create isolator-style effects.
