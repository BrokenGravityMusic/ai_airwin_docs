BiquadTriple

A cascaded biquad filter with steeper roll-off before resonance, ideal for steep filter slopes without cutoff resonance.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Frequency: Adjusts the frequency of each biquad filter.
* Q: Sets the Q factor (bandwidth) for each biquad filter.
* Dry/Wet/Inv: Controls the mix between the original signal and the processed signal. Note: This is a 3-band setup, with Wet/Dry/Wet equivalent to Inv/Dry/Wet.

* Biquad settings: Configure each individual biquad filter.

Caveats:
Be cautious when adjusting controls abruptly, as extreme settings may cause instability. The filters can be sensitive to specific Q factor settings and stacking configurations.

Best Use Cases:
Use BiquadTriple for steep filter slopes without resonance issues. Ideal for mocking up effects and testing filter combinations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Be cautious when adjusting frequency and Q factors to avoid resonance.
* Use the 3-band setup to create a shelf effect by bleeding in dry signal.
* Experiment with staggered Q factors to create isolator-style effects.
