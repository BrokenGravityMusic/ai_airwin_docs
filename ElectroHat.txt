ElectroHat

Key Controls and Settings:

* Control Voltage (CV): feeds some sort of CV to the plugin, can be amplitude modulated for effects.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Not specified
* Underlying Signal: accepts a square wave tone, which will be rectified to positive only, simulating a control voltage.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Square wave

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for generating hi-hat tones with unique characteristics and imperfections.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with amplitude modulation of the CV for interesting effects.
Use a square wave tone as the underlying signal to rectify it and simulate a control voltage.
