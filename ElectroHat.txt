ElectroHat

A hi-hat tone generator that uses original sound as a control voltage.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Control Voltage (CV): feeds some sort of CV to the plugin, can be amplitude modulated for effects.
	+ Range: not specified
	+ Type: CV
* Underlying Signal: accepts a square wave tone, which will be rectified to positive only, simulating a control voltage.

Caveats:

Generates artifacts and peculiar electronic noises due to its primitive residue sequence method.

Best Use Cases:

Ideal for generating hi-hat tones with unique characteristics and imperfections.
Use in experimental or creative music production scenarios to create complex, interesting sounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Experiment with amplitude modulation of the CV for interesting effects.
Use a square wave tone as the underlying signal to rectify it and simulate a control voltage.
Feed a control voltage to the plugin for dynamic response.
Rectify square wave tones as an underlying signal for consistent results.
