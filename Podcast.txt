A pile of curve-style compressors in series for dynamic range control, with hard clipping.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Multiple Compressors: A series of 5 curve-style compressors in a chain.
	+ Each compressor can be adjusted independently
* Dry/Wet Control: A blend between the original signal and the compressed signal
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release: Adjust compressor settings as desired
* Hard Clip: Enables or disables hard clipping on output

Caveats:
No latency; does not produce pumping and swelling effects or sidechainy whooshes of level due to curve school compression; quits changing levels if input goes silent; hard-clips the output.

Best Use Cases:
Aggressively smashing drums and percussion elements; buss compression for adding glue to mixes; safety compressor for protecting signals from over-clip.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For drum smashing, turn up ratio and attack times to create a "crushing" effect. For buss compression, start with a moderate threshold and ratio. To use as a clean buss comp, turn down the gain makeup and adjust the compressor settings for a gentle, subtle effect.
