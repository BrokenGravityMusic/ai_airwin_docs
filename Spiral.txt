Spiral

A novel approach to distortion and saturation that introduces discontinuities at zero crossings, perceived as a "fatter, smooth" sound but also creates an unpleasant discontinuity.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Zero Crossing:` [insert text]
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Discontinuity Correction:` A simple correction to fix the issue of discontinuities at zero crossings
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
The sine-based overdrive algorithm used in previous plugins, such as Channel, also creates discontinuities at zero crossings.

Best Use Cases:
Use Spiral when a smooth and pleasing distortion effect is desired. However, for applications where the sine-based curve is still optimal, consider using that instead.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start by adjusting the Zero Crossing control to minimize discontinuities, then adjust the Discontinuity Correction control to fix any remaining issues.
