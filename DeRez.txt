DeRez

Analog-style bit and sample rate crusher with continuous adjustments.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Frequency`: Control for continuously sweeping sample-rate crushing
    + To adjust: Slide the control down to change the frequency
* `Resolution`: Control for continuously sweeping bit crushing
    + To adjust: Slide the control down to change the resolution
* `Bit Crunching Algorithm`: A floating-point algorithm at high resolution, which can sweep through any size of 'bit' without transition points


Best Use Cases:

* For constructing strange models of obscure old digital gear, use DeRez to dial in the right amount of bitcrunch after using a compressor like PurestConsole.
* For automating controls in your DAW to program continuous sweeps.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To get the best results from DeRez, experiment with adjusting the Frequency and Resolution controls to achieve the desired analog-style bit and sample rate crushing.
