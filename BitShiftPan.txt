BitShiftPan

A gain and pan control plugin that uses bit shifts to apply 6 dB increments, allowing for lossless mixing and gain adjustments in the digital domain.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bits`: Select the number of bits to shift for gain and/or pan.
	+ Adjusting this setting will apply a precise 6 dB or other multiple of 6 dB gain/loss adjustment to the selected tracks.
	+ When used for pan, applies a shift to the stereo field with no law applied (no 3 dB pan law).
* `Gain Shift`: Not mentioned explicitly but implied in "gain trim" and "precise gain control"
* `Pan Control`: Shifting the pan position using bit shifts, allowing for precise placement within the stereo field.
	+ Each step is equivalent to a 6dB decrease or increase in signal level.

Caveats:
* BitShiftPan is not suitable for mixing with traditional, granular adjustments.
* Limited resolution and accuracy due to bit shift operation (3 dB steps instead of continuous pan law).
* Mixing with BitShiftPan in mono can be impossibly crude due to 6 dB increments being seemingly impossible to mix with.

Best Use Cases:
* When mixing in a lossless, transparent manner, prioritizing raw unprocessed intensity from the original digital captures.
* In situations where precise control over the stereo field is required.
* Mixing tracks that require precise, lossless gain control.
* Creating bespoke panning techniques using discrete bit shifts.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different bit shift values to achieve desired gain or pan adjustments.
* Take advantage of BitShiftPan's ability to apply precise 6 dB increments for gain and/or pan, even when mixing multiple tracks.
* Start by adjusting the Number of Bits to achieve desired gain trim levels.
* When using Track Shift (implied as "gain trim"), start with small adjustments (0.75 dB or 1.5 dB) to achieve desired results.
