BitShiftPan

A gain and pan control plugin that uses bit shifts to apply 6 dB increments, allowing for lossless mixing and gain adjustments in the digital domain.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Bits`: Select the number of bits to shift for gain and/or pan.
    + Adjusting this setting will apply a precise 6 dB or other multiple of 6 dB gain/loss adjustment to the selected tracks.
    + When used for pan, applies a shift to the stereo field with no law applied (no 3 dB pan law).
* `Gain Shift`: Adjusts the gain by precise 6 dB increments using bit shifting.
* `Pan Shift`: Adjusts the pan position by precise bit shifting, resulting in a "steppy" positioning with no pan law.

Best Use Cases:
* Ideal for mixing and gain adjustment scenarios where utmost transparency and losslessness are required.
* Suitable for applications where precision and accuracy are paramount.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different bit shift values to achieve desired gain or pan adjustments.
* When using Track Shift (if applicable), start with small adjustments (0.75 dB or 1.5 dB) to achieve desired results.
