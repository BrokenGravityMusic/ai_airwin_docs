Shape
`Asymmetrical waveshaper for peak manipulating`
Key Controls and Settings:

* Shape control:
    + 0.5: no effect
    + 1.0: stretching out the peaks of the waveform
    + 0.0: squishing the peaks of the waveform
* Offset control:
    + 0.5: no offset
    + 0.0: negative offset
    + 1.0: positive offset

Best Use Cases:
 
* Sound design: pull out or squash parts of the waveform by favoring one side over the other.
* Bass manipulation: make it warmer or purer by adjusting Shape and Offset.
* Reshaping waveforms: create triangle-ey or squared results from a sine input.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Don't crank up controls; use gentle, subtle adjustments for transparent effects.
* Use offset to favor one side of the waveform over the other.
* Stack multiple instances for more pronounced effects.
