Shape

An asymmetrical waveshaper for peak manipulating.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Shape control: determines the effect (0.5 = no effect, 1.0 = stretching out peaks, 0.0 = squishing peaks)
	+ Range: scales all effects
* Offset control:
	+ 0.5: no offset
	+ 0.0: negative offset
	+ 1.0: positive offset

Caveats:

* The Shape control's effect should be used gradually, as cranking it out can lead to unpleasant waveshaping tricks.
* The Offset control can interact with the Shape control to make it affect only one side of the waveform.

Best Use Cases:

* Reshaping waveforms so asymmetrically creates built-in even harmonics, which can add warmth to sounds.
* The plugin is suitable for sound design and tweaking tonal adjustments with great purity and subtlety.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* To get a sound to swing fully in both directions, set the offset to favor one side and adjust the Shape control accordingly.
* For warmer basses, use more Shape to create a triangle-ey result or less Shape for a squared result, then lean the Offset one way or the other.
