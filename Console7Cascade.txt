Console7Cascade

A drop-in replacement for Console7Channel that allows for much higher gain and a more intense tubey loud effect with very little scratchiness or grind.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain Staging:` Works with the trim control to fit the result into the mix.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `Number of Stages:` Five individually ultrasonic-filtered stages
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `Filtering:` More gentle filtering between individual stages than a single stage with super-filtering
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified

Caveats:
May be CPU-intensive due to the use of five Console7Channels, each running two sine functions.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing drums: It worked well on drums, making it a potential default choice for that.
* Submixing: Can be used on individual submixes or all submixes for an intense tubey loud effect.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust gain staging and filtering to fit the result into the mix. Consider using Console7Cascade on individual tracks or submixes for a more controlled effect.
