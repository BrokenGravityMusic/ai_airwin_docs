Console7Cascade

A drop-in replacement for Console7Channel that allows for much higher gain and a more intense tubey loud effect with very little scratchiness or grind.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain Staging`: Works with the trim control to fit the result into the mix.
* `Filtering`: Five individually ultrasonic-filtered stages of slamming, allowing for gentle filtering between individual stages.
    + Ultrasonic filtering between individual stages, rather than super-filtering all at once.
* `Number of Gain Stages`: Five gain stages of the same processing in Console7Channel.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing drums: It worked well on drums, making it a potential default choice for that.
* Submixing: Can be used on individual submixes or all submixes for an intense tubey loud effect.
* Intensive loudening of channels or submixes.
* Potential use as a guitar amp simulator.

Tips:
Adjust the gain staging and filtering to suit your specific mix needs. Use sparingly due to CPU concerns.
To avoid excessive crunch, filter more gently between individual stages.
