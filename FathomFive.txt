FathomFive

Supplements extreme bass, acting like a combination between an EQ and a bass amp, using a special Airwindows algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Gain: Adjusts the overall level of the plugin.
* Tone Control: Affects the frequency response of the plugin.
* Bass Amp: Adjusts the level of bass amp simulation.
* Low End Boost: Adjusts the amount of low-end boost using a custom Airwindows algorithm.
* Freq: Sets the frequency range for the low-end boost.
* Gain: Adjusts the overall gain of the plugin.

Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original, though not explicitly mentioned, is assumed to be available as per typical plugins in this category. 

Caveats:
FathomFive can spit out excessive DC offsets if not managed properly. Monitor the plugin's output to avoid this issue. This is an older plugin and may produce unwanted effects.

Best Use Cases:
FathomFive is suitable for sound design, isolated tracks, or as part of an Airwindows DAW workflow. It's particularly useful when supplementing extreme bass in these scenarios.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use FathomFive in conjunction with Console4 to achieve a big-sounding mix while minimizing processing on most mix elements. Adjust the tone control and gain accordingly to suit your needs, taking care not to produce excessive DC offsets.
