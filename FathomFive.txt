Caveats:
This is an older plugin and may produce excessive DC offsets if not managed properly. Monitor the plugin's output closely to avoid this issue.

Best Use Cases:
FathomFive is suitable for sound design, isolated tracks, or as part of an Airwindows DAW workflow. It can also be used with Console4 to achieve a big-sounding mix while minimizing processing on most mix elements.
