Console8BussHype

Simulates an improved 8-bus topology with analog characteristics, offering a brighter and sparklier circuit compared to Console8BussIn.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Topology`: Switch between bus, channel, or submix routing.
* `Analog Simulation`: Engage for a brighter and sparklier circuit, replacing the original Console8BussIn configuration.
* `Swap Circuit:` Allows you to switch between the original Console8BussIn circuit and the new, brighter sparklier circuit provided by this plugin.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mixing and mastering applications where an enhanced 8-bus topology is desired. Also useful when seeking an alternative analog simulation sound with a brighter and more sparkling character compared to Console8BussIn.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Topology to suit your mixing style. Engage Analog Simulation for a brighter sound, but be aware it replaces the original Console8BussIn configuration. Use Swap Circuit to choose between the two circuits based on your needs.
