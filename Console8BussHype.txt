Console8BussHype

Simulates an improved 8-bus topology with analog characteristics, providing a brighter and sparklier design compared to Console8BussIn.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Topology:` Switch between bus, channel, or submix routing.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Dropdown selection
* `Swap mode (or Swap Circuit):` A switch to enable or disable the simulated upgrade, allowing you to choose between the original Console8BussIn circuit and a brighter, sparklier design.
	+ Range: On/Off
	+ Type: Toggle button
* `Analog Simulation:` Engage for a brighter and sparklier circuit (same as Swap mode in other versions).
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Toggle button

Caveats:
None documented.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mixing and mastering applications where an enhanced 8-bus topology is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust Topology to suit your mixing style.
* Engage Analog Simulation (or Swap mode) for a brighter sound, but be aware it replaces the original Console8BussIn configuration.
