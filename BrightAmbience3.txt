BrightAmbience3

A very bright gated reverb that adds undersampling for high sample rates and better feedback.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet`: Adjusts the balance between the original sound and the reverb effect.
	+ Range: 
* `Decay Control`: Sets the rate at which the reverb decays over time. (Note: This control does not affect CPU efficiency.)
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: 
* `Sustain Control`: Sets the level of sustain, which is tied to maximum sample delay. Higher sample rates will result in shorter sustains and denser "shininess".
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: 
* `Feedback Control`: Allows you to feed back the reverb effect at wider settings.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: 

Caveats:

* The plugin is CPU-hungry due to its naive method of processing.
* Running at high sample rates can help reduce CPU usage and maintain a consistent tone.
* Feedback may introduce resonant qualities or droney effects, especially at wider reverb settings.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding a halo of shiny sound around mono content
* Creating distinctively analog-feeling blurred delay effects
* Using as a reverb effect at medium to wide settings

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the Sustain Control to balance sustain and CPU efficiency.
* Experiment with Feedback Control to achieve desired resonant or droney effects.
* Run the plugin at high sample rates for optimal performance.
