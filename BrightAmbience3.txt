BrightAmbience3

A very bright gated reverb that adds undersampling for high sample rates and better feedback.
`Key Controls and Settings:`
* `Dry/Wet`: Adjusts the balance between the original sound and the reverb effect.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Blend control
* `Sustain Control`: Sets the level of sustain, which is tied to maximum sample delay. Higher sample rates will result in shorter sustains and denser "shininess".
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Level control
* `Decay Control`: Sets the rate at which the reverb decays over time.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Time control
* `Feedback Control`: Allows you to feed back the reverb effect at wider settings.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: Level control
`Best Use Cases:`
* Adding a halo of shiny sound around mono content
* Creating distinctively analog-feeling blurred delay effects
* Using as a reverb effect at medium to wide settings
