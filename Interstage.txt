Acceleration Limiter

A mastering-grade acceleration limiter that targets digital behavior causing Gibb effect overshoots, while leaving the basic mix balance intact.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Adjusts the level at which acceleration begins.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `Slew Limit`: Controls the amount of clipping applied to the signal, with lower values allowing for more subtle limiting.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `Range`: Controls the extent of acceleration applied to high frequencies.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `Response Curve`: Selects from a range of tonal responses for shaping the high-frequency character.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified

Caveats:
Interstage does not eliminate DC offset or preserve output peaks of heavily limited material. It will reshape lows in a way that may increase peak levels as deepest lows get rearranged.

Best Use Cases:

* Taming excessive digital brightness in mastering-grade mixes.
* Correcting Gibb effect overshoots without altering mix balance.
* Enhancing the analog-like sound of modern productions.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Threshold to start applying acceleration around -20 dBFS. Set Range to 1-2 for a moderate, tonal shaping effect. Experiment with Response Curve to find the perfect tone for your mix.
