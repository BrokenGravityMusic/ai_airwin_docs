Acceleration Limiter (formerly Acceleration)

A mastering-grade acceleration limiter that targets digital behavior causing Gibb effect overshoots, while leaving the basic mix balance intact.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Adjusts the level at which acceleration begins.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: [insert type]
* `Slew Limit`: Controls the amount of clipping applied to the signal, with lower values allowing for more subtle limiting.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: [insert type]

Best Use Cases:
Use to clean up excessively digital bass and treble, particularly when working with ITB mixes or edgy source material.
Taming excessive digital brightness in mastering-grade mixes.
Correcting Gibb effect overshoots without altering mix balance.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Threshold control to balance between preserving clarity and limiting excessive treble energy. Experiment with the Slew Limit setting to find the optimal amount of clipping for your specific audio material.
Adjust Threshold to start applying acceleration around -20 dBFS.
Set Range to 1-2 for a moderate, tonal shaping effect.

Caveats:
Interstage does not eliminate DC offset or preserve output peaks of heavily limited material. It will reshape lows in a way that may increase peak levels as deepest lows get rearranged.
