Gatelope

A special gate that applies filters to reject unwanted frequencies and sustain desired ones.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Threshold: Adjust the level at which the gate starts to operate.
	+ Recommended method of use: find the proper gating threshold with this top slider.
* Attack Speed: Fine-tune the speed at which the gate responds to input changes.
* Treble Sustain: Regulate how long high-frequency signals are sustained after the gate closes.
* Bass Sustain: Control how long low-frequency signals are sustained after the gate closes.
* Dry/Wet Ratio: Blend the original signal with the gated effect to achieve the desired balance.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Tightening up spot mics on kick drums by rejecting low frequency rumble and sustaining high frequencies. Rejecting cymbal bleed from tom mics while preserving low-end sustain.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with Attack Speed and Sustain settings to achieve the desired effect. Adjust Dry/Wet Ratio to balance the gated sound with the original signal.
