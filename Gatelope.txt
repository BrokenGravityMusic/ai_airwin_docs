Key Controls and Settings:

* Threshold: Adjusts the level at which the gate starts to operate.
	+ Recommended method of use: find the proper gating threshold with this top slider.
* Attack Speed: Fine-tune the speed at which the gate responds to input changes.
	+ May be adjusted depending on where you find the optimal threshold point.
* Treble Sustain: Regulate how long high-frequency signals are sustained after the gate closes.
* Bass Sustain: Control how long low-frequency signals are sustained after the gate closes.
* Dry/Wet Ratio: Blend the original signal with the gated effect to achieve a balanced sound.

Best Use Cases:

* Tightening up spot mics on kick drums by rejecting low frequency rumble and sustaining high frequencies.
* Rejecting cymbal bleed from tom mics while preserving low-end sustain.
