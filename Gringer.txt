Gringer

A full-wave rectifier plugin, similar to a Green Ringer guitar effect, that applies full-wave rectification and emulates analog circuitry.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Top control (shelves):
	+ Lowpass
	+ Highpass
	+ Bandpass
	+ Notch
* Frequency setting:
	+ Range from zero to one (in "amount of the audio range")
	+ Zero not really DC, One not really Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate)
* Biquad bandpasses:
	+ VERY wide bandwidth

Caveats:

* Avoid using on mastering consoles as it may introduce unwanted artifacts
* Use caution when applying to sensitive audio signals
* Will not remove huge DC offsets; will remove smaller ones just fine

Best Use Cases: 
Ideal for adding unique tone color to guitar solo or other audio material

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use by ear to find suitable settings; can cover DC to Nyquist at any sample rate. Bypass the plugin when not needed to minimize CPU usage.
