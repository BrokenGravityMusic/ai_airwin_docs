Full-Wave Rectifier

A full-wave rectifier plugin, similar to a Green Ringer guitar effect, with a biquad filter that applies full-wave rectification, mimicking analog circuitry and DC-blocking capacitors.

Key Controls and Settings: None. The plugin can be bypassed to disable its effects.

Caveats:
* Will not remove huge DC offsets
* Avoid using on mastering consoles, as it may introduce unwanted artifacts.
* Use caution when applying to sensitive audio signals.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for use on guitar solo or other audio material where a unique tone color is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use by ear to find suitable settings. Can cover DC to Nyquist at any sample rate.
Bypass the plugin when not needed to minimize CPU usage.
