Air3

Creates a new form of air-band EQ based on Kalman filtering, projecting a hypothetical underlying sound and incorporating sensor readings to remove "noise" from the air band.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain:` Adjusts the overall level of the processed audio.
* `Gnd (Ground):` Lowers the overall frequency response, removing high-end detail and glare.
* `Air:` Boosts or cuts the air band frequencies, depending on its position relative to the Gnd control.

Caveats:

* Unpredictable results when boosting the Air control heavily while cutting the Gnd control.
* May not function as a traditional EQ due to its unconventional algorithm.

Best Use Cases:

* Reduction of tizz, glare, and detail in high-frequency sounds.
* Enhancement of audio clarity by emphasizing the air band frequencies.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Use subtly for best results.
* Experiment with different settings to find optimal balance between air-band EQ and ground control.
