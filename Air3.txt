Air3

Creates a new form of air-band EQ based on Kalman filtering.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Gain: Adjusts the overall level of the processed audio.
* Gnd (Ground): Lowers the overall frequency response, removing high-end detail and glare.
* Air: Boosts or cuts the air band frequencies, depending on its position relative to the Gnd control.
	+ Unpredictable behavior can occur when boosting the Air control heavily and cutting the Gnd control.
* Kalman Filter Control (hidden within Air): Adjusts the amount of filtering applied to the air band.

Caveats:
Unpredictable results when boosting the Air control heavily while cutting the Gnd control.
May not function as a traditional EQ due to its unconventional algorithm.

Best Use Cases:
Reduction of tizz, glare, and detail in high-frequency sounds.
Enhancement of audio clarity by emphasizing the air band frequencies.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use the controls subtly for the best results.
Experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance between air-band EQ and ground control.
