Best Use Cases:

* For producing intensely saturated sound with resistance to intersample peaking
* For extreme, competitive loudness
* Stacking ADClip8 with a whole array of FinalClips in series for complex processing

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust mode and ceiling settings based on specific needs and material
* Experiment with different stage settings to achieve desired sound characteristics ("bigger, bassier, thicker")
* Use Apotheosis mode for extremely moderate transparent clipping of challenging material
* Don't overdo it â€“ excessive use can lead to a "competitive loudness" sound that's not desirable
