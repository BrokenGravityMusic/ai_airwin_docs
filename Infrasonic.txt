Ultrasonic

A supersonic filter that cleans up aliasing problems in digital mixes by removing frequencies above 20KHz.
Key Controls and Settings:
* None, as this is a featureless add-and-forget plugin. The plugin uses a super high resolution tenth-order Butterworth lowpass filter with five poles.
Caveats:
* Not suitable for mastering highpasses due to steepness and phase shift.
* May introduce a slight texture change or "slickness" to processed audio.
Best Use Cases:
* In digital mixes where aliasing is a concern, especially at high sample rates (96k or 192k).
* To clean up nonlinearities in other plugins that can produce aliasing problems.
Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Insert the plugin before any nonlinear processing to effectively remove aliasing.
* Experiment with using Ultrasonic on every channel in a digital mix to smooth out and un-digitalize the sound.
