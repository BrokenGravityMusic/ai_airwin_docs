Ultrasonic

A supersonic filter that cleans up aliasing problems in digital mixes by removing frequencies above 20KHz.

Key Controls and Settings:

* The plugin uses a super high resolution tenth-order Butterworth lowpass filter with five poles.

Caveats:
* Not suitable for mastering highpasses due to steepness and phase shift.
* Best used as a special effects filter or sound design tool.

Best Use Cases:
* In digital mixes where aliasing is a concern, especially at high sample rates (96k or 192k).
* To clean up nonlinearities in other plugins that can produce aliasing problems.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Use the plugin before any potential aliasing sources.
* Chain it with other plugins to further refine your mix.
