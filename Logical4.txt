Logical4 2-Buss Compressor

A classic 2-buss compressor designed for demanding conditions, offering spot-on tone, transparency, and the ability to let music through.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Adjusts the point at which compression begins.
    + Range: Below a 2/1 ratio
* `Speed`: Controls the attack time of the compressor.
    + Type: Swing and spring-back behavior
* `Ratio`:
    + Stage 1: Up to 2/1 ratio for maximum transparency
    + Stage 2-3: From 2/1 to 4/1 ratio, offering various behaviors and a clean sound
    + Stage 3 (max): Approximate 16/1 ratio, introducing tone change and allowing for extreme compression
* `Mix:` Not applicable

Caveats:
Be cautious when cranking the ratio, as excessive compression can lead to output distortion.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for 2-buss compression in demanding conditions, such as mastering or heavy mixing situations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Keep ratios below 2/1 for transparent compression.
Adjust speed control for desired "swing" behavior at higher ratios (2/1-4/1).
Monitor output levels when pushing the ratio above 4/1 to avoid uncontrolled gain.
