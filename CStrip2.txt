CStrip2

A refined and optimized channel strip plugin that includes a capacitor-based highpass and lowpass, compressor, saturation effect, and delay-trim and gate removal.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Highpass:
	+ Frequency (Hz): controls the cutoff frequency of the highpass filter
	+ Range: Adjustable within specified range
	+ Type: Capacitor EQ
* Lowpass:
	+ Frequency (Hz): controls the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter
	+ Range: Adjustable within specified range
	+ Type: Capacitor EQ
* Compressor:
	+ Threshold (-20 dB): sets the compression threshold level
	+ Ratio (x): sets the compression ratio
	+ Attack Time (ms): sets the attack time for the compressor
	+ Release Time (ms): sets the release time for the compressor
	+ Makeup Gain (dB): adds gain to compensate for compression
	+ Range: Adjustable within specified range
	+ Type: Compression
* Saturation:
	+ Drive Level: controls the level of saturation applied to the output signal
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Type: Output saturation based on Spiral and Density algorithms

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mixing and mastering applications where a high-quality channel strip is required. Also suitable for use in VCV Rack (or CLAP) environments with limited controls.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with the capacitor-based EQ to create interesting frequency responses. Keep the saturation level below 1/3 dry signal level for clean output, or crossfade into Spiral and Density algorithms for unique distortion effects.
