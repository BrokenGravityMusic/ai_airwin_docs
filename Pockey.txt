Pockey

Plugin designed to give a warm fuzzy texture like an old sampler or Pocket Operator for 12 bit lo-fi hiphop sounds

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Resolution Slider:` Adjusts the resolution from exactly 12 bit to progressively more lo-fi in an 'analog bitcrush' mode.
	+ Lowest setting: Exactly 12 bit
	+ Higher settings: Gradually builds, fading smoothly from higher resolutions to 4-bit
* `Frequency Crush Effect:`
	+ Uses edge-softening algorithm like PurestDrive for resonant and sonorous frequency crush.
	+ Adjusts the level of digital nasty effects, with lower settings minimizing intrusion.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for lo-fi hiphop and similar genres that benefit from warm fuzzy textures. Also ideal for emulating 12-bit lo-fi hiphop sound in genres like chill lo-fi hip hop, where a warm fuzzy texture and crunchy louder sounds are desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* For minimal intrusion, adjust frequency control to very lowest settings.
* As you crank up the frequency crush effect, note the rowdier digital artifacts with a softening effect. Start with low resolution and frequency crush settings to preserve clarity, then gradually increase for desired lo-fi effect. Experiment with the edge-softening algorithm to achieve the right balance between harsh and resonant frequencies.
