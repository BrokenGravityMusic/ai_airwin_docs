Caveats:
GrindAmp has limited dynamics and no over-hang beyond the immediate sound, resulting in a truncated cabinet emulation effect.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating a Rockman-type, extremely direct and dry tone, or an amped, miked tone with low-end punch. Useful for arranging parts and emphasizing certain qualities in your music.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different gain levels to achieve a percussive effect, and use the Dry/Wet control to balance the amount of dry guitar sound against the amp sim.
