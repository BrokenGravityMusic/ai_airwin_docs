Caveats:
Truncated cab emulation means minimal cabinet rumble or overhang. This plugin is designed for heavy rock tones and may not be suitable for other genres.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating a Rockman-type, extremely direct and dry tone, or an amped, miked tone with low-end punch. Useful for arranging parts and emphasizing certain qualities in your music.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different gain levels to achieve a percussive effect. Use the Dry/Wet control to balance the amount of dry guitar sound against the amp sim.
