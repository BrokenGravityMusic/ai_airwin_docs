Srsly2

A plugin that revises and extends the functionality of Srsly, creating an extreme stereo widening effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Center:` A control for adjusting the center image.
* `Space:` A control for adjusting the stereo wideness, which can be cranked up to create a wild and boosted stereo field.
* `Q:` Adjusts the resonance of the mid and side channels for finer control over stereo widening.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal scenarios include using Srsly2 on reverb returns or as a way to enhance stereo content in mixing. It is also suitable for creating an ultra-wide reverb field, where extreme width and depth manipulation in the stereo field are desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Leaving the Center control alone and cranking up the Space control can achieve a wild and somewhat boosted and hyped zone, making the most of your spectacular stereo content. Experiment with different Q values to refine the mid and side channel resonance for more precise effects.
