A plugin that revises and extends the functionality of Srsly, creating an extreme stereo widening effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Center:` A control for adjusting the center image.
    + Range: -1 to 1 (default: 0)
* `Space:` A control for adjusting the stereo wideness, which can be cranked up to create a wild and boosted stereo field.
    + Range: 0 to 10 (default: 5)
* `Q:` Adjusts the resonance of the mid and side channels for finer control over stereo widening.
    + Range: 1 to 10 (default: 5)

Best Use Cases:
Ideal scenarios include using Srsly2 on reverb returns or as a way to enhance stereo content in mixing. It is also suitable for creating an ultra-wide reverb field, particularly when used in situations where extreme stereo widening is desired, such as creating a wide and immersive reverb field or enhancing the spatiality of stereo content.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Leaving the Center control alone and cranking up the Space control can achieve a wild and somewhat boosted and hyped zone, making the most of your spectacular stereo content. Experimenting with different Q values can help refine the mid and side channel resonance for optimal results.
