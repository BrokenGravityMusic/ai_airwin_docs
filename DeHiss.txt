DeHiss

Suppresses background hiss using a filtery gate approach.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Lowpass Filter`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter to suppress quiet background noise.
* `Dry/Wet`: Blend between original signal (dry) and filtered signal (wet).
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Threshold`: Adjusts the level above which the lowpass filter is applied to quiet background noise.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:

* Suppressing background hiss from cheap USB condenser mics.
* Creative tone-shaping or adding character to sounds.
* Suppressing background hiss on recordings made with low-quality microphones or equipment.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start by adjusting the Lowpass Filter cutoff frequency to around 100-200 Hz to target low-frequency rumble and hiss.
* Adjust the Dry/Wet blend to taste, using subtle amounts of filtering for a more natural sound.
* Use Threshold to balance desired noise reduction and signal clarity.
