DeHiss

Suppresses background hiss using a filter-like gate approach.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Lowpass Filter`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter to suppress quiet background noise.
    + Range: 100-200 Hz (start point for targeting low-frequency rumble and hiss)
* `Dry/Wet`: Blend between original signal (dry) and filtered signal (wet).
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Adjusting this control allows for creative uses, such as subtle tone-shaping or adding character to a sound.
* `Threshold` (optional): Adjusts the level above which the lowpass filter is applied to quiet background noise.

Best Use Cases:

* Suppressing background hiss from cheap USB condenser mics.
* Creative tone-shaping or adding character to sounds.
* Reducing unwanted noise in quiet audio recordings.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start by adjusting the Lowpass Filter cutoff frequency to around 100-200 Hz to target low-frequency rumble and hiss. Adjust the Dry/Wet blend to taste, using subtle amounts of filtering for a more natural sound.
