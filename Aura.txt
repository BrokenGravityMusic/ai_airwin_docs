Aura

A resonant lowpass EQ that averages the rate of change OF the rate of change of the waveform.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Dry/Wet control: Adjusts the amount of effect, with enhanced resonant quality at full wet.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Tip: Explore half-wet or barely-wet settings for optimal results
* Resonance control:
	+ Range: Not mentioned in the provided text

Caveats:

* The plugin's algorithm can be unstable when expanded beyond its intended frequency range, particularly into the bass frequencies.
* Pre-ring is absent due to the unique implementation method.
* Be cautious with half-wet or barely-wet settings as it can become too scary-resonant.

Best Use Cases:

* Projecting audio as if from an acoustic space.
* Enhancing treble effects in a mix.
* Cutting or enhancing treble texture in a mix.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different dry/wet settings to find the optimal balance between effect and original signal.
* Pull back on the resonance control if the plugin becomes too resonant.
* Use Aura in conjunction with other plugins or effects to create interesting textures in your mix.
