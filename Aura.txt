Aura

A resonant lowpass EQ that averages the rate of change OF the rate of the waveform.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet control`: Adjusts the amount of effect applied to the signal, with full wet enhancing the resonant quality.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Tip: Explore half-wet or barely-wet settings for optimal results.
* `Resonance control`: Sets the degree of resonance in the lowpass EQ.

Best Use Cases:
* Projecting audio as if from an acoustic space.
* Enhancing treble effects in a mix.
* Cutting or enhancing treble texture in a mix.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different dry/wet settings to find the optimal balance between effect and original signal.
* Pull back on the resonance control if the plugin becomes too resonant.
* Use Aura aggressively on suitable elements to manipulate texture in your mix, but be gentle when adjusting the Dry/Wet control.
