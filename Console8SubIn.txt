Console8SubIn

Converts an input bus into a submix topology with analog simulation.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Channel selection: Select the input bus to convert.
* Submix topology: Choose from various submix configurations (e.g. 2-channel, 4-channel).
* Analog simulation: Select the desired analog model for processing (e.g. "warm", "vintage").
* Gain: Adjust the overall gain level of the output signal.

Best Use Cases:

Use Console8SubIn to create a submix topology for mixing and mastering, or to add analog warmth to an input bus. Ideal for mixing and mastering applications where a channel/submix/buss topology is desired, such as creating a stereo mix from multiple tracks or adding analog warmth to a signal chain.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different submix topologies or analog simulation modes to find the best configuration for your sound. Adjust the gain level to match the desired output level of your signal.
