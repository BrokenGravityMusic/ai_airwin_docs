Caveats:
May require a second to stabilize if used in tightly trimmed audio regions. Rough handling of the delay time control can lead to choppy sound.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating vintage sounds, subtle echoes, and reverb-like effects with tone shaping capabilities.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the region and frequency controls to taste for optimal tone shaping results. Experiment with different dry/wet mixes to achieve the desired balance between original and echoed audio. Use the tape flutter feature subtly for a wavery and irregular effect, or crank it up for a more pronounced warbly quality.
