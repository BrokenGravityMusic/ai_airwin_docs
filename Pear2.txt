Pear2

A filter plugin based on the Holt algorithm, offering a highpass/lowpass shelf with adjustable cutoff frequency and pole count. It also features nonlinearity calculation for added tonal coloration.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Cutoff`: Smoothed control to adjust the cutoff frequency of the filter.
* `Poles`: Adjusts the number of poles in the filter (switchable to restrict or add poles).
    + `Restrict Poles`: Switches off the ability to sweep the poles count.
* `Nonlin`: Control for adding nonlinearity to the filter's output, which affects the tone and dynamics of the sound.

Best Use Cases:
* As a crossover filter in audio processing chains
* For creating a vibey analog-style EQ (high or low shelf)
* Experimenting with unusual tonal colors and effects

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust the cutoff frequency to suit your desired tone and response.
* Add poles to increase the complexity and richness of the sound, but be aware that excessive pole count may introduce unwanted artifacts.
* Use the Nonlin control judiciously to add subtle nuances or more pronounced tonal colors, depending on your musical needs.
