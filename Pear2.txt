Pear2

A highpass/lowpass shelf filter with nonlinearity, based on Holt algorithm and bit-shifting frequency control.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff`: Smoothed control for sweeping the cutoff points.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: Smoothed control
* `Poles`: Control for adding poles to the filter. A switch is available to disable Poles sweep.
	+ Range: 1-8 poles
	+ Type: Switchable poles count
* `Nonlin`: Nonlinearity control that adds analog coloration and emphasizes transients.
	+ Range: Minimal to extreme distortion
	+ Type: Control for adding nonlinearity

Caveats:
None mentioned.

Best Use Cases:

* As a vibey analog-style EQ (high or low shelf).
* As a crossover filter.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different settings of Poles to achieve desired tone.
* Adjust the Nonlin control to add or reduce analog coloration and transient emphasis.
* Start with moderate Nonlin setting (around 50%) and adjust to taste.
* Use Cutoff control to sweep frequency response, but be mindful of nonlinearity effects.
