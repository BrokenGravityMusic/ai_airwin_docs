BiquadNonLin

A 4-band frequency filter for sound processing.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Type:` 
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Type: selector (lowpass, bandpass)
* `Inv/Wet control:` 
	+ Range: -100% to 100%
	+ Type: blend control
* `NonLin:` 
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: nonlinearity control

Caveats:
Sweeping up the filter at high NonLin settings can make nonlinearity more audible.

Best Use Cases:
Stacking biquad filters for a typical DAW EQ sound, creating a distributed ultrasonic filter, or using as the guts of a future ConsoleSL plugin.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Setting Type to 0 is lowpass, setting it to 1 is bandpass. High NonLin values enhance nonlinearity. Use Inv instead of Wet for highpasses and notches.
