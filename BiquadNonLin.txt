BiquadNonLin

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Type:` 
	+ Range: 0 (lowpass) to 1 (bandpass)
* `Inv/Wet control:` Use Inv instead of Wet for highpasses or notches
* `NonLinearity:` Set to high values (e.g. 0.5) for more obvious effects

Best Use Cases:
* Stacking biquad filters to create a typical DAW EQ sound
* Adding nonlinearity to a steep, resonant filter
* Creating a distributed ultrasonic filter

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Type at 0 is a lowpass, Type at 1 is a bandpass
* Set NonLin to high values (e.g. 0.5) to enhance nonlinearity
* Use Inv instead of dry/wet control for highpasses and notches
* Sweep the filter up at high NonLin settings to make nonlinearity more apparent
