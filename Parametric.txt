Parametric

A three-band EQ that provides detailed tone shaping, similar to an SSL-style console.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Three bands of EQ, each with frequency, gain, and bandwidth controls.
	+ Frequency control: Adjusts the center frequency of each band (Band 1: 50 Hz - 200 Hz, Band 2: 200 Hz - 800 Hz, Band 3: 800 Hz - 5 kHz).
	+ Gain control: Boosts or cuts the level of each band.
	+ Bandwidth control: Tightens or widens the resonance of each filter (Q range: 0.3 - 20).
* Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Detailed tone shaping for individual tracks or submixes, ideal for SSL-style EQ applications.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use the Low Mid control to extend into bass range and tighten bandwidth by turning Q left. Adjust gain and slope controls for each band to shape desired frequency response.
