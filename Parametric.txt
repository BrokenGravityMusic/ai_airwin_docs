Function Overview: A three-band EQ that provides detailed tone shaping, similar to an SSL-style console.
The Low Mid band extends into the bass.

* Three bands of EQ, each with frequency, gain, and bandwidth controls.
	+ Frequency control: Adjusts the center frequency of each band.
	+ Gain control: Boosts or cuts the level of each band.
	+ Bandwidth control: Tightens or widens the resonance of each filter.

Best Use Cases:
Detailed tone shaping for individual tracks or submixes. Adding energy and power around dynamics to enhance the overall sound.

Band 1: EQ section with controls for Gain, Frequency (50 Hz - 200 Hz), Q (0.3 - 20), and Slope.
Band 2: EQ section with controls for Gain, Frequency (200 Hz - 800 Hz), Q (0.3 - 20), and Slope.
Band 3: EQ section with controls for Gain, Frequency (800 Hz - 5 kHz), Q (0.3 - 20), and Slope.
