A highpass filter plugin designed to mimic the sound and behavior of the Emu E6400 Ultra highpass.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Slope:` Adjusts the steepness of the highpass filter.
    + Range: Not specified, but implies a range of options for user adjustment
    + Type: Numerical control
* `Frequency:` Sets the cutoff frequency of the highpass filter.
    + Range: Not specified, but implies a range of frequencies for user selection
    + Type: Frequency setting
* `Q:` Adjusts the resonance or "attack" characteristic of the highpass filter.
    + Range: Not specified, but implies a range of options for user adjustment
    + Type: Numerical control
* `Hard-Clip:` Enables a hard-clipping effect, similar to the original device.
    + Range: On/Off toggle

Best Use Cases:
Aggressive filtering and sound design in electronic music genres such as DnB and techno. Creating unique and aggressive sounds for tracks and effects processing.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different slope settings to find the desired highpass effect. Adjust the frequency setting to suit the specific audio material being processed. Use the Q control to fine-tune the resonance of the highpass filter and achieve the desired sound.
