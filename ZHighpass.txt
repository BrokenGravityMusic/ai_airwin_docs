Mackity

Emulates the input stage of a vintage Mackie 1202 mixer.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Insert Point: Plug into halfway to emulate the effects of running audio through the original Mackie 1202.
* Intensity: Adjusts the level of "spongy slam" and "gleaming brain-fry overload".
* EQ Matching: Not over-processed, allowing for a more intense and raw sound.

Caveats:
May not perfectly cancel out with a phase-inverted recording from the real physical machine.
Will not generate noise like cheap op-amps.

Best Use Cases:
Electronic music production, particularly DnB and underground genres.
Adding character to audio tracks by emulating vintage mixer behavior.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different settings to find the desired level of "spongy slam" and intensity.
Adjust EQ matching as needed to balance the sound.
