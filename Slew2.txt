Slew2

Controls extreme highs in a sound, useful as a de-esser or acceleration limiter.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Slider: Sets the threshold where Slew2 refuses to let more brightness through.
	+ Turning up this slider makes Slew2 harder to exceed.
* Dry/Wet control (post-video revision): Moderates the effect of Slew2, allowing for a balance between the filtered sound and the original.

Best Use Cases:

* De-essing: Slew2 is well-suited for removing harsh high frequencies from vocals or other sounds.
* High-end control: The brickwall filter response makes it ideal for controlling extreme highs in a mix.
* Classic analog tone: Using Slew2 on the 2-buss can help achieve a warm, classic sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different settings to find the right balance between controlling extreme highs and preserving lower treble. Use the slider to set a threshold where Slew2 will refuse to let more brightness through, especially in mastering scenarios.
