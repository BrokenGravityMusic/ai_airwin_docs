PurestFade

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Fader Time`: Adjusts the fade time in seconds (8-0.001). Dragging slower than 10 seconds allows for any slowness of fade.
	+ Range: 0.1 seconds to 8 seconds
	+ Type: Slider
* `Manual Control`: Manually controls the fade speed. If set faster than the automatic fade, it will chase your fade speed.
	+ Range: Adjustable 
	+ Type: Slider
* `Top Control`: Allows rapid moves if needed. Also useful for assigning to a hardware controller.
	+ Range: Adjustable 
	+ Type: Slider

Caveats:
Manually dragging the fader speed control can create abrupt, dynamic effects, which may not be suitable for all mixing scenarios.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating smooth and gradual fades from maximum volume to silence.
* Mixing, where subtle fader movements are preferred.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For best results, adjust the `Fader Time` control to achieve the desired fade duration. If needed, use the `Manual Control` for more rapid or dynamic fades.
