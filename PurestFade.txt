PurestFade

A plugin designed to create smooth and gradual fades from maximum volume to silence.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Fader Time`: Adjusts the fade time in seconds (8-0.001). Dragging slower than 10 seconds allows for any slowness of fade.
* `Manual Control`: Manually controls the fade speed. If set faster than the automatic fade, it will chase your fade speed.
* `Top Control`: Allows rapid moves if needed. Also useful for assigning to a hardware controller.

Caveats:
None mentioned in the documentation.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating smooth and gradual fades from maximum volume to silence.
* Mixing, where subtle fader movements are preferred.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For best results, adjust the `Fader Time` control to achieve the desired fade duration. Use the `Manual Control` for more rapid or dynamic fades if needed.

To achieve the ultimate smoothed fade, adjust the fader speed control according to your desired fade time.
Use PurestGain if you prefer abrupt, dynamic effects, while opting for PurestFade when aiming for subtle, invisible fades.
