DigitalBlack

A staccato gate designed to tighten up direct-recorded tracks by fading into negative density and using hysteresis to prevent 'sputtering'.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Set the level above which the gate will operate.
* `Dry/Wet`: Control the amount of processed signal mixed with the original sound.
* `Fade into Negative Density`: Adjust the rate at which the gate fades into silence, sounding like it's fading backwards.

Caveats:
None noted

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for tightening up staccato direct-recorded tracks, such as DI guitars, kick drums, and individual drum mics. Not suitable for linked stereo tracks; use DigitalBlackMono on mono sources in AU.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the threshold and dry/wet controls to balance the amount of processing applied. Experiment with different settings to find the optimal combination for your specific audio material.
