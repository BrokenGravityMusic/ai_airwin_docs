SpatializeDither

A high-performance clarity and accuracy dither with a holographic, intense sonic reality.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Type: Determines the type of dither to use (default: Contingent Dither).
	+ Blend Amount: Adjusts the balance between random noise and contingent dither.
	+ Quantization Value: Sets the quantization value for samples that hit perfectly on boundaries.

Caveats:
May not be perfectly well-behaved down around the noise floor. Can produce a strong highpassy effect.

Best Use Cases:

For achieving hyper-real, high-definition sound with extreme clarity and accuracy. When precision and accuracy are paramount.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Blend Amounts to find the desired balance between random noise and contingent dither. Adjust Quantization Value to suit specific applications.
