Channel7

A three-pole IIR highpass filter that improves slew clipping and allows seamless blending between Channel 6's Spiral algorithm and Channel 5's Density algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Level:` Adjusts the overall gain.
* `Blend:` A crossfade control that transitions between Channel 6 (Spiral) and Channel 5 (Density) algorithms, affecting the amount of saturation and fatness added to the sound.
    + Up to 100%: Same as Channel 6, with improved slew clipping.
    + From 100% to 200%: Fades into Channel 5's Density algorithm.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for situations where a balance between clean, saturated, and fat sounds is desired. Perfect for upgrading from previous Channel plugins.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust the Blend control to taste, experimenting with different settings to achieve the desired balance between Spiral's purity and Density's saturation.
* If using high sample rates, ensure Channel7 handles them well by checking its slew clipping performance.
