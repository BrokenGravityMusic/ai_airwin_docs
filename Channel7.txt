Channel 7 Plugin

A three-pole IIR highpass filter that subtracts a pre-averaged sample and slew limits against an initial stage IIR lowpassed reference point.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Level:` Adjusts the overall gain.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: 
* `Gain`: A gain control that goes up to 200%, with:
	+ Up to 100%: same as Channel 6, but with improved slew clipping
	+ 100-200%: crossfades into Channel 5's Density algorithm
* `Blend Control`: A slider or switch that smoothly transitions between the two algorithms

Caveats:

* Does not eliminate DC offset
* Reshapes lows in a characteristic way, allowing extended lows
* Restricts treble slews based on overall energy in the circuit
* Slew clipping fix is most noticeable at high sample rates

Best Use Cases:

* Adding analog-like character to audio without heavy processing
* Correcting for slew clipping at high sample rates
* Blending with other plugins to create a unique sound
* Upgrading from previous Channels for improved slew clipping and blending options
* Seeking a balance between clean, saturated sound with added fatness
* Fading between Spiral's purity and Density's saturation

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with the gain control to find the right balance of clarity and saturation
* Adjust the blend control to smoothly transition between the two algorithms for unique soundscapes
* Adjust the Blend control to taste, experimenting with different settings to achieve the desired balance between Spiral's purity and Density's saturation
* If using high sample rates, ensure Channel7 handles them well by checking its slew clipping performance
