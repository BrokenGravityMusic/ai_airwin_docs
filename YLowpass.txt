YLowpass

A low-pass filter plugin with interpolated coefficients, reducing zipper noise, and double ultrasonic filtering.

* `Resonant Edge`: Adjusts the internal distortion of filters, affecting sound warmth and edginess. Normal position is around 0.1.
    + Less than normal: Produces a slightly asymmetrical distortion for warm analog filter sounds.
    + Greater than normal: Allows for more aggressive, glitchy sounds.
* `Filter Cutoff`: Sets the low-pass filter cutoff frequency.
* `Gain`: Adjusts the overall gain of the plugin.

Heavy CPU usage due to complex filtering algorithms and double ultrasonic filtering. Potential issues with zipper noise reduction may be mitigated by adjusting settings.

Ideal for adding warmth and analog character to digital synths, or creating aggressive, glitchy sounds in electronic music productions.

Adjust Resonant Edge to around 0.1 for a balanced tone. Experiment with greater or lesser values of Resonant Edge to achieve desired filter characteristics. Use gain staging techniques to optimize overall sound quality.
