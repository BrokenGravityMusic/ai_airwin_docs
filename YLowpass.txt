YLowpass

A low-pass filter with interpolated coefficients, double ultrasonic filtering, and internal distortion capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Resonant Edge`: Adjusts the resonant frequency of the filter, affecting its tone and character.
	+ Less than normal: Produces a slightly asymmetrical distortion for warm analog filter sounds.
	+ Greater than normal: Allows for more aggressive, glitchy sounds (set to around 0.1 for balanced tone).
* `Filter Type`: Interpolated coefficients with double ultrasonic filtering.

Caveats:

* Heavy CPU usage due to complex filtering algorithms.
* Potential issues with zipper noise reduction may be mitigated by adjusting settings.

Best Use Cases:

* Warm and smooth low-pass filtering for general audio processing.
* Aggressive, glitchy sound design for experimental and electronic music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust Resonant Edge to around 0.1 for a balanced tone.
* Experiment with greater or lesser values of Resonant Edge to achieve desired filter characteristics.
* Use YLowpass in conjunction with other plugins to further refine and optimize sound design.
