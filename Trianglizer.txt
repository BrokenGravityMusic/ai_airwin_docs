Trianglizer

A waveshaper that transforms sines into triangles or triangle-like waves, also capable of adding saturation and dynamic effects.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Tri/Fat Control`: Adjusts the shape of the output wave from a sharp triangle to a rounded trapezoid.
	+ Range: Tri for sharp, Fat for rounded
	+ Type: Waveform modifier
* `Dry-Wet Control`: Blends the original signal with the processed signal to control the amount of effect applied.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control

Caveats:
The plugin's ability to transform sines into triangles or add saturation is dependent on the input level, with louder signals producing sharper triangle-like waves and softer signals producing rounder shapes.

Best Use Cases:
Adding dynamic effects to music tracks, enhancing the articulation of sine-based instruments like basses, creating a retro sound similar to old Kinks albums or early Sixties music.

Tips on Optimal Settings: 
To achieve the best results, use the Trianglizer set to "Tri" for sharp and lean effects, and set to "Fat" for added punch and saturation. Adjust the Dry-Wet control to balance the amount of effect applied.
