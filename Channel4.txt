	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Knob
* `Slew Clipper`: A calibrated slew clipper to approximate analog limitations.

Best Use Cases:
Use Channel4 on individual tracks or busses to add warmth, character, and analog feel to your mix. Ideal for giving a retro or vintage sound to instruments, drums, or vocals.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Keep Saturation Drive at 50% or under for a clean, pure tone coloration.
* Adjust Slew Amount to taste, but be aware that it darkens treble in an unusual way.
