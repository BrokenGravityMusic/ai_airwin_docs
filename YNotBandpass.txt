Soft and smooth bandpass filter with texture-varying filtering capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Freq:` Adjusts the frequency cutoff of the bandpass filter.
* `ResEdge:` Controls the resonance and edge characteristics of the filter, adding a mean, electrical quality to the sound.
* No control smoothing: Prevents the plugin from smoothing out rapid changes in settings.

Best Use Cases:
Creating unique tone effects on vocals or instruments; Adding texture and interest to large reverb environments; Simulating a "walkie-talkie" tone or other distinctive soundscapes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For a smooth, bandpass-like effect, set Freq and ResEdge to moderate values. To create a more edgy, textured sound, increase ResEdge while adjusting Freq for optimal results. Use the "no control smoothing" feature to take advantage of rapid switching between Freq settings in combination with large reverb environments.
