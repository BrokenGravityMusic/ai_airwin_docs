YNotBandpass

A soft and smooth to nasty, edgy texture-varying filter with no control smoothing.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Freq`: Sets the frequency of the bandpass filter.
	+ Adjust: Use a pot or slider to change the Freq value.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `ResEdge`: Adds edge and nastiness to the filter response.
	+ Adjust: Use a pot or slider to increase or decrease ResEdge.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* No control smoothing is applied, allowing for rapid changes between different settings.

Caveats:
Using high ResEdge values can introduce an electrical, circuit-bendy quality that may not be desirable in all situations. The filter's behavior can change rapidly when adjusting Freq with no control smoothing enabled.

Best Use Cases:
Creating a unique tone or texture on vocals or instruments. Adding edge and nastiness to sounds without losing depth.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with rapid changes between different Freq settings for interesting results. Use high ResEdge values sparingly, as they can introduce an unpleasant quality to the sound.
