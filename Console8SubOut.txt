Caveats:
Incorrect use of Unity Gain may result in distortion.

Best Use Cases:
Place ChannelIn, SubIn, and BussIn first on channels, submixes, and master buss. Place ChannelOut, SubOut, and BussOut last on channels, submixes, and master buss.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use unity gain between Out plugins and In plugin on each stage (channel/submix/master buss). Faders on the Out plugins are good to assign to midi controllers so you can adjust them with physical controls and not the mouse. The faders on ChannelOut, SubOut, and BussOut fade down to zero at levels below 0.5 and boost by approximately 12dB at levels above 0.5 (channel and submixes).
