Lowpass2

A variable-slope lowpass filter with adjustable cutoff frequency, unique tone colors, and strong experimental sound design capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Control:` Adjusts the cutoff frequency from complete silence to wide open.
	+ Goes from complete silence to wide open no matter what sample rate you're at
	+ Interacts with Soft/Hard slider to vary the cutoff based on input sample value
* `Soft/Hard Slider:` Varies the cutoff frequency based on input sample value
	+ Can roll off harder for peaks of sound or let them through more
	+ Has two distinct tone colors and special effects at four poles of filter
* `Poles Control:` Selects from zero to four poles of filter, increasing the effect strength and sharpness of roll-off

Caveats:
Using high sample rates can affect the filter's behavior at wide open settings.
The cutoff frequency may not stay the same with changes in the Soft/Hard slider or Poles control.

Best Use Cases:
Experimental tone shaping
Sound design

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different pole counts to achieve desired roll-off sharpness.
Adjust the Soft/Hard slider to emphasize specific frequency ranges or create special effects like wind noise from pink noise.
