Lowpass2

A variable-slope lowpass filter with adjustable cutoff frequency, using interleaved IIR filters to produce subtle bleed-through of information near the Nyquist frequency.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency from complete silence to wide open.
	+ Goes from complete silence to wide open no matter what sample rate you're at
	+ Interacts with Soft/Hard slider to vary the cutoff based on input sample value
* `Soft/Hard Slider`: Varies the cutoff frequency based on input sample value, allowing for subtle tone color modifications.
	+ Can roll off harder for peaks of sound or let them through more
	+ Has two distinct tone colors and special effects at four poles of filter
* `Poles Control`: Selects from zero to four poles of filter, affecting the strength and sharpness of the roll-off.

Caveats:
Sample rate affects the cutoff frequency, but not in a way that limits its range.
The cutoff frequency will not remain the same when adjusting the Soft/Hard slider or increasing the number of poles.

Best Use Cases:
Experimental tone shaping
Sound design

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Filter Control to desired cutoff frequency.
Experiment with Soft/Hard Slider for different tone colors and special effects.
Use four poles of filter for strongest effect and sharpest roll-off.
