Loud

A distortion plugin that models air molecule distortion, allowing for extreme nonlinearity and dynamic range control.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Distortion Level`: Adjusts the overall distortion amount, from subtle to extreme.
    + Range: 0-100
    + Default value: Not specified
* `Compress/Release Control`:
    + `Compress Time`: Sets the time for compressing air molecules.
    + `Release Time`: Controls the speed at which compressed air molecules rebound.
* `Heat Control`: Increases heat when air molecules are compressed, affecting distortion sound.

Caveats:

* Extreme settings can result in unsoundable levels beyond human hearing range.
* Proper gain staging is essential to avoid audible artifacts.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding scope and authority to a mix by applying subtle yet aggressive distortion.
* Enhancing individual tracks like guitars and drums with intense ferocity.
* Creating a unique sonic glue effect at zero boost.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with low Distortion Level settings for subtle coloration, then gradually increase for more extreme effects.
* Adjust Compress/Release Control to balance compression and release times, depending on the desired sound.
* Use Heat Control to further shape distortion sound.
