Console8BussOut

Analog simulator that converts a plugin's output to a channel, submix, or buss topology, adding warmth and character to individual tracks or mixes.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Topology:` Select the type of topology for the plugin's output (channel, submix, or buss).
	+ Type: [choose one: Channel/Submix/Buss]
* `Analog Simulation:` Adjust the level of analog simulation applied to the output.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Choose from various analog simulation modes (e.g. preamp, EQ, compressor)
* `Gain Staging:` Adjust the gain level of the simulated signal.
	+ Range: -20 dB to +20 dB
	+ Type: Linear or Logarithmic gain staging
* `Impedance:` Set the impedance of the analog circuitry.
	+ Range: 10kOhm to 100kOhm

Caveats:
Be aware that increasing analog simulation can introduce noise and artifacts.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing and mastering applications where a more authentic, analog sound is desired.
* Adding warmth and character to individual tracks or submixes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with minimal gain staging (0-3 dB) and minimal analog simulation (0-10%). Adjust topology, gain staging, and impedance based on your mixing or mastering needs. Experiment with different analog simulation types to find the desired tone.
