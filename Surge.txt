Surge

A compressor for accentuating beats and pulses by altering the rate of change of dynamics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Adjusts the level at which compression begins. (Range: -inf dB to 0 dB, Type: slider)
* `Ratio`: Sets the amount of compression applied. (Range: 1:1 to âˆž:1, Type: selector)
* `Attack`: Controls the time it takes for the compressor to respond to changes in audio levels. (Range: 10 ms to 1000 ms, Type: slider)
* `Release`: Determines how quickly the compressor recovers after a transient has passed. (Range: 50 ms to 500 ms, Type: slider)

Caveats:
Avoid over-compression, as this can invert dynamics and make the audio sound unnatural.

Best Use Cases:
Compressing mixes with strong rhythmic elements to accentuate beats and pulses.
Transforming bassy mixes into something punchier.
Adding funk and character to audio signals.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Threshold to around -20 dB for best results.
Use Ratio between 5:1 to 10:1 for most musical compression.
Experiment with Attack and Release settings (around 50-100 ms) for a smooth response.
