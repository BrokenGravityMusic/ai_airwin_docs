Surge

A compressor for accentuating beats and pulses by altering the rate of change of dynamics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Threshold: Adjusts the level at which compression begins
	+ Range: [not specified]
	+ Type: Input level
* Ratio: Sets the amount of compression applied
	+ Range: Not specified, but recommended between 5:1 to 10:1
	+ Type: Compression ratio
* Attack: Controls the time it takes for the compressor to respond to changes in audio levels
	+ Range: Not specified, but recommended around 50-100 ms
	+ Type: Time response
* Release: Determines how quickly the compressor recovers after a transient has passed
	+ Range: Not specified, but recommended balanced between preservation of dynamic range and emphasis of rhythmic elements
	+ Type: Time response

Caveats:
Can be difficult to control when used aggressively.
May not provide limiter-like behavior.

Best Use Cases:
Accentuating beats and pulses in rhythmic mixes.
Transforming compressed bassy mixes into something punchier.
Creating funky, bouncy sounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Threshold to avoid inverting dynamics.
Use Ratio between 5:1 to 10:1 for most musical compression.
Experiment with Attack and Release settings to fine-tune response times.
