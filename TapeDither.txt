A digital dithering algorithm designed to mimic the sound of reel-to-reel tape noise, suitable for use in analog mixing and summing.

* `Delay Time:` Powers-of-two delay times (1, 2, 4, 8 samples) produce a more pleasing tone.
    + Range: 1 sample to 8 samples
    + Type: Integer value

Best Use Cases:

* Analog mixing and summing
* Sending processed stems or tracks outboard to a multichannel DAC
