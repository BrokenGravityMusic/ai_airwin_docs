TapeDither

A TPDF (Triangular Pulse Density Function) dithering algorithm with a softer tonal voicing that rolls off in an obvious way around 1.5K Hz, similar to reel-to-reel tape noise.

Key Controls and Settings:


* `Delay Time:`
	+ Range: Powers-of-two delay times (1, 2, 4, 8 samples)
	+ Type: Integer
* `Noise Inversion:`
	+ Range: Toggleable inversion of the noise
	+ Type: Boolean

Caveats:
TapeDither is not suitable for use on the 2-buss; fancier boutique dithers are recommended instead.

Best Use Cases:

* Analog mixing and summing: TapeDither provides a natural-sounding dither that won't introduce an exaggerated tone signature when stacked up with multiple tracks.
* Outboard processing: Send processed stems or tracks outboard to a multichannel DAC for mixing or summing, using TapeDither to preserve a relaxed tone signature.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different delay times (powers-of-two) and noise inversion settings to find the optimal combination that suits your specific application.
