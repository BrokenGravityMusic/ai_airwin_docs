Reverb

A simplified reverb simulator that adjusts its settings on-the-fly to best suit a desired size of reverberant space.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Size`: A single slider controlling the "bigness" or size of the reverberant space. Adjusting this parameter affects the overall spaciousness and ambiance of the sound.
	+ Range: This control adjusts the size of the reverb space from smaller, more intimate areas to larger, more cavernous spaces.
* `Dry/Wet`: A balance control between the original dry signal and the simulated reverb.
	+ Range: This control blends the processed sound with the original, allowing for a mix that suits your musical context.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating a specific size and ambiance of a reverberant space for music production, post-production, or live performance.
* Quickly adjusting the reverb size to suit different musical or audio contexts.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Size slider to achieve the desired level of spaciousness and ambiance for your sound. Balance the Dry/Wet control to find the optimal mix between original signal and simulated reverb.
