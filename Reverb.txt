Reverb

A simplified and tuned plugin that simulates an optimum-sized reverb space, adapting on-the-fly to best suit whatever size of space you seek.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Size Control:` A single slider that adjusts the "bigness" of the reverb space. Adjusting this control allows for a quick optimization of the reverb size.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Slider
* `Dry/Wet Mix:` Controls the balance between the dry (original) signal and the wet (reverberated) signal.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control

Best Use Cases:

* Creating a reverb space that simulates an optimal-sized room or environment.
* Quickly adjusting the reverb size to suit different musical or audio contexts.
* Using as a starting point for more complex reverb simulations with other plugins.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Size Control slider to achieve the desired level of reverberance, and balance the Dry/Wet Mix control to find the optimal mix between original signal and simulated reverb.
