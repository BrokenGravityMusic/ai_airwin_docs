Caveats:
None listed.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating narrow, high-resonance sounds as a "synth filter" tone, or for adding edge to filter sweeps. Also useful in music production and mixing, post-production audio work, such as film and video game sound design.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different resonance settings to achieve the desired tonal characteristics. Adjust smoothing and cutoff controls in conjunction with each other to achieve optimal results. Use smoothing to create a more gradual change in filtering effect, especially when automating parameters. Adjust resonance boost to add edge and depth to the filtered sound.
