Capacitor

A lowpass/highpass filter with a unique tone for DAYS, offering an analog-synth-like effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Frequency Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency between highpass and lowpass modes.
	+ Range: Reaches 1 (full crank) seamlessly bypasses itself while still calculating the filtered signal
	+ Type: Control
* `High/Low Mode Switcher`: Selects between highpass and lowpass filtering
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: Switch
* `Dry/Wet Mix Control`: Adjusts the balance between the filtered and dry signals.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: Blend control

Caveats:
Has a little characteristic response quirk at 1/3 the sampling rate, resulting in an odd notch under some circumstances. May not be suitable for precise or critical applications due to its unique implementation details.

Best Use Cases:
Tightening bass or rolling off brightness in mastering; Creating presence boosts by isolating areas of interest; Using as a shelf or presence enhancer

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with the frequency control and dry/wet mix to find the ideal balance for your specific needs. Use automation to take advantage of the filter's ability to reject zipper noise and clicks.
