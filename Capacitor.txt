Capacitor

A lowpass/highpass filter with a unique tone for DAYS, offering an analog-synth-like effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Frequency Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency between highpass and lowpass modes.
	+ Reaches 1 (full crank) seamlessly bypasses itself while still calculating the filtered signal
* `High/Low Mode Switcher`: Selects between highpass and lowpass filtering.
* `Dry/Wet Mix Control`: Adjusts the balance between the filtered and dry signals.

Caveats:
Has a little characteristic response quirk at 1/3 the sampling rate, resulting in an odd little notch under some circumstances. May not be suitable for precise or critical applications due to its unique implementation details.

Best Use Cases:

* Tightening bass or rolling off brightness in mastering
* Creating presence boosts by isolating areas of interest
* Using as a shelf or presence enhancer
