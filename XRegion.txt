A plugin that applies distorted staggered bandpasses to sound signals for extreme sound mangling.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `First`: Sets the first frequency point for filtering.
	+ Range: not specified
	+ Type: frequency control
* `Last`: Sets the last frequency point for filtering.
	+ Range: not specified
	+ Type: frequency control
* `Nuke`: Increases the number of filtering poles, affecting gain and distortion.
	+ Range: not specified
	+ Type: control for engaging more poles of filtering
* `Dry/Wet`: Balances the intensity of the effect by mixing it with an unprocessed signal.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: blend control

Caveats:
* Can produce zipper noise when adjusting on the fly due to its experimental nature.
* May not be suitable for all users, especially those seeking subtle effects.

Best Use Cases:
* Creating intense bandpass effects, such as distorting a snare sound.
* Generating filter-sweepy, highly distorted effects.
* Achieving an overdriven bass amp kind of tone.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* To get a nice smooth distort, don't spread First and Last too wide or set them too high or low. Balance the result with Dry/Wet.
* Use caution when adjusting Nuke, as it can increase gain significantly.
