ZHighpass2

Emulates a high-pass filter with coefficient interpolation, mimicking the behavior of the Emu e6400 Ultra sampler's tone and behavior.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Input`: Set to 0.1 for unity gain, adjust as needed.
	+ Range: Adjust input level
	+ Type: Input level control
* `Output`: Pad or amplify the signal using this control.
	+ Range: Vary output level
	+ Type: Output level control
* `Wet Control` (Highpass Frequency): Emulate a high-pass filter with coefficient interpolation.
	+ Range: Adjust cutoff frequency
	+ Type: Highpass filter cutoff control
* `Gain and Distortion`: Set high for aggressive filtering.
	+ Range: Vary gain and distortion
	+ Type: Gain and distortion control

Caveats:
Uninitialized variable in previous version fixed. Keep input and output levels low to avoid excessive distortion.

Best Use Cases:
High-passing instruments or signals for added clarity, automating the filter cutoff for dynamic effects, achieving aggressive tone with intentional overdrive.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Keep input and output levels moderate to avoid distortion, adjust smoothing as needed for optimal coefficient interpolation, sweep highpass frequency judiciously, especially when driven hard.
