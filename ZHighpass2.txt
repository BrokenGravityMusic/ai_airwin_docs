ZHighpass2


Emulates a highpass filter inspired by the Emu e6400 Ultra sampler's tone and behavior.


Key Controls and Settings:
* `Input`: The input level of the signal.
	+ To achieve unity gain, set to 0.1 or lower.
* `Output`: The output level of the filtered signal.
	+ Use to pad the signal if needed.
* `Highpass Frequency`: Not mentioned (use discretion)
* `Wet Control`: Automate and smooth with coefficient interpolation for a more dynamic sound.
	+ Type: not specified
* `Gain and Distortion`: Set high for aggressive filtering.
	+ Range: not specified


Caveats:
Keep input and output levels low to avoid excessive distortion.
Uninitialized variable in previous version fixed; redownload ZLowpass2 if necessary.
Unstable behavior may occur when sweeping the highpass frequency too high, due to output stage characteristics not unlike Mackity.


Best Use Cases:
High-passing instruments or signals for added clarity.
Automating the filter cutoff for dynamic effects.
Achieving aggressive tone with intentional overdrive.


Tips on Optimal Settings:
Keep input and output levels moderate to avoid distortion.
Adjust smoothing as needed for optimal coefficient interpolation.
Sweep highpass frequency judiciously, especially when driven hard.
