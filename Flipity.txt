Flipity

A utility plugin that flips or swaps the phase of audio channels, allowing for various combinations of left and right channel manipulation.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Channel selection: Choose which channel(s) to manipulate (left, right, both)
* Flip mode: Select from multiple options, including flipping one channel, swapping channels, and combining flip and swap operations
* Phase inversion: Invert the phase of the selected channel(s)

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for use cases where phase manipulation or stereo imaging modification are desired, such as correcting phase issues in a mix, creating unusual spatial effects, or manipulating stereo width or depth.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a simple channel swap and adjust as needed. Experiment with different flip modes to achieve the desired effect. Use channel selection to isolate specific audio sources for manipulation.
