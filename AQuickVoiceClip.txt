AQuickVoiceClip

Softens headset mic recordings with super hard clipping on capture.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Clipping Softener:` Adjusts the amount of softening applied to clipped audio moments. Range: 0-100%.
* `Highpass Cutoff:` Sets the frequency cutoff for the highpass filter. Range: 20 Hz - 20000 Hz.

Caveats:
Best used on single voice tracks that have wildly distorted moments, not suitable for multi-track processing (e.g., 2-buss).

Best Use Cases:
Processing headset mic recordings with loud clipping, ideal for YouTube-style content creation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with the Clipping Softener to find the optimal balance between softening and preserving audio quality.
Adjust the Highpass Cutoff to suit the specific frequency characteristics of your recordings.
