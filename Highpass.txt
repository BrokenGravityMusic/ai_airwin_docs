A time warp filter that creates retro midrangey sounds, suitable for mixing applications.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Soft/Hard (or Loose/Tight)`: Controls how the IIR filters are fed audio. Adjusting this parameter affects tone-character modification on a sample-by-sample basis.
    + Adjusting away from center position can cut extreme treble at shallow settings. At deeper cut settings, it gives two different textures that keep a hint of 'air' right up top.
* `Dry/Wet`: A blend control that allows you to mix the filtered sound with the original audio.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating retro midrangey sounds in mixing applications. Suitable for use with synth pads, orchestral tracks, and other large instrumental settings.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* To create a "classic" sound, set the Soft/Hard parameter to "loose".
* To achieve intense texture shaping, dial in your boost area (not explicitly listed but implied as an option) and balance it with dry/wet.
* Use the Dry/Wet control to blend the filtered sound with the original audio for a more natural sound.
