Recurve

A special buss compressor with no threshold point that uses a high-resolution sine calculation to affect sound, scaling part of itself relative to the loudness of the sample.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain Boost`: A 6dB clean boost that doubles the gain for medium signal levels.
	+ Available range: n/a
	+ Type: Clean gain boost
* `Clipper`: An output clipper to prevent transient attacks from poking out.
	+ Range: n/a
	+ Type: Output clipper
* `Stereo Linking`: Allows for true (linked) stereo operation.
	+ Range: n/a
	+ Type: Stereo linking control

Caveats:
Recurve does not perform sidechainy pumping, use another plugin if needed. The gain adjustment style may result in no compression pumping and breathing.

Best Use Cases:
Mixing into the compressor as a buss-comp or limiter form for maximum explosiveness and impressiveness. Using as a clipper on the output to prevent transient attacks from poking out.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Recurve as a buss-comp or limiter form for best results. Adjust the Gain Boost to 6dB for maximum effect. Engage Clipper to prevent transient attacks from poking out.
