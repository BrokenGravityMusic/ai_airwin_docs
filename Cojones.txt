Cojones

A plugin that tracks the trajectory of a waveform over five samples, allowing for heightening or minimizing disparities to create a unique sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cojones`: A control that boosts or minimizes waveform disparities.
	+ Boosting Cojones can add a midrangey sonority.
	+ Note: It's easy to apply too much Cojones, so start with small amounts.
* Breathy: A three-sample control that adds a breathy quality to the sound.
* Body: A control that beefs up or cuts bass and low mids.

Caveats:
Cojones is best used in moderation. Excessive use can produce unpleasant, trebly grit.

Best Use Cases:

* Add Cojones to your mix or master bus for a distinctive midrangey sonority.
* Experiment with Cojones as an alternative to Dither Me Timbers or StudioTan, especially when used in non-output dither contexts.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with small amounts of Cojones and gradually increase to avoid excessive boosting. Be cautious not to overapply the "mojo" effect.
