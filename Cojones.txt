Cojones

A plugin that tracks the trajectory of a waveform (over five samples) to heighten or minimize disparities, resulting in a distinctive midrangey sonority.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cojones`: Boosts or reduces the disparity in waveforms.
    + Adjusting this control will affect the overall sound quality.
* `Breathy`: Adds a three-sample effect similar to Dither Me Timbers and StudioTan.
    + This control can be used to add energy to transients and attacks.
* `Body`: Controls bass and low mids, beefing them up or cutting them out.
    + This control can be used to adjust the balance of low frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
* Add Cojones to your mix or master bus for a distinctive midrangey sonority.
* Experiment with Cojones as an alternative to Dither Me Timbers or StudioTan, especially when used in non-output dither contexts.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with small amounts of Cojones and gradually increase it to taste. Adjust the Breathy control carefully, as excessive use can make your sound too "breathless". Use the Body control to balance out low frequencies and avoid muddiness.
