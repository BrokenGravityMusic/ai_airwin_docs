Isolator

A steep highpass or lowpass filter, like a speaker crossover.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Type`: Choose between lowpass and highpass.
* `Frequency Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the filter, allowing for accurate control over the full Nyquist range. Midrange always in the middle of the control. Seamless bypasses itself at maximum frequency while still calculating the filtered signal.
    + Range: 0 to max sample rate
    + Type: logarithmic scale
* `Treble and Bass`: Controls for shelving or output gain, designed for instant response.

Caveats:
Avoid using the filter control as an oscillator input. Avoid excessive filter-sweep activity in areas with high energy, as this can cause instability. Using Treble and Bass Controls on heavily bassy sounds may result in clicks.

Best Use Cases:

* Classic 'now it's all bass... and now the full mix gradually swells up' effect
* Cutting highs or lows with accuracy
* Using as a shelf for subtle cuts in highs or lows

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use the filter control to sweep from lowpass to highpass. To avoid clicks when using treble and bass controls, use them sparingly with heavily bassy sounds.
