Isolator

A steep highpass or lowpass filter, like a speaker crossover, for precise control over highs and lows in audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Filter Type`: Choose between lowpass and highpass.
* `Frequency Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the filter with a range of 0 to max sample rate, providing accurate control over the full Nyquist range.
	+ Range: 0 to 1 (max sample rate)
	+ Type: logarithmic
* `Treble` and `Bass`: Controls for shelving or output gain, designed for instant response.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]

Caveats:
* Avoid using the filter control as an oscillator input, as biquads may not handle it well.
* Avoid excessive filter-sweep activity in areas with high energy, as this can cause instability.
* Do not use the frequency control for Frequency Modulation (FM), as biquads may sound distorted under such treatment.

Best Use Cases:
* Classic 'now it's all bass... and now the full mix gradually swells up' effect
* Cutting highs or lows with accuracy
* Using as a shelf for subtle cuts in highs or lows

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* For best results, use the filter control to sweep from lowpass to highpass.
* To avoid clicks when using treble and bass controls, use them sparingly with heavily bassy sounds.
