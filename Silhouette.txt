Silhouette
`Replaces the sound with raw noise sculpted to match its dynamics.`
Key Controls and Settings:

* `Wet/Dry`: Controls the amount of noise injected into the sound, from 0 (no effect) to 1 (full replacement).

Caveats:
Silhouette is designed to replace the entire sound with noise, rather than adding texture or ambiance.
It's intended for experimental use, where the goal is to create a wild, unexpected effect.

Best Use Cases:
Experimental mixing and creative effects
Illustrating loudness war concepts
Generating subliminal noise for specific sonic textures

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with minimal Wet/Dry settings (around 0.1-0.2) to gauge the effect.
Adjust the Wet/Dry control carefully, as it can quickly become overpowering.
Use Silhouette sparingly and in context-sensitive mixing environments.
