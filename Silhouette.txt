Silhouette

Replaces the sound with raw noise sculpted to match its dynamics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Wet/Dry`: Controls the amount of noise injected into the sound, from 0 (no effect) to 1 (full replacement).
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control
* `Gain`: Not mentioned as a control in this text. Assume default or minimal gain for best results.
	+ Tip: Be cautious not to turn Wet/Dry up too high, as it can become obvious and overpower the original sound.

Caveats:
Silhouette is designed to replace the entire sound with noise, rather than adding texture or ambiance. It's intended for experimental use, where the goal is to create a wild, unexpected effect. This plugin may not work well with all types of audio content.

Best Use Cases:
Experimental mixing and creative effects, illustrating loudness war concepts, generating subliminal noise for specific sonic textures.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with minimal Wet/Dry settings (around 0.1-0.2) to gauge the effect. Adjust the Wet/Dry control carefully, as it can quickly become overpowering. Use Silhouette sparingly and in context-sensitive mixing environments.
