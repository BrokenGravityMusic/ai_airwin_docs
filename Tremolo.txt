Tremolo

A plugin that uses fluctuating saturation curves to achieve a distinctive "tubey" tremolo effect, unlike built-in DAW tremolos.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Saturation Curve`: Adjusts the curve of saturation used for the tremolo effect. Higher values add more density and thickness to the sound.
	+ Range: 0-100%
	+ Type: Saturation
* `Antisaturation Curve`: Adjusts the curve of antisaturation used for the lean parts of the sound. Lower values help preserve transient attacks.
	+ Range: 0-100%
	+ Type: Antisaturation

Best Use Cases:

* Adding depth and character to sounds by creating a pulsating effect that enhances dynamics and density.
* Creating distinctive, "analog-sounding" effects that set your music apart from DAW-generated tremolos.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with the Saturation Curve to find the right balance between added density and compromised transient attacks. Adjust the Antisaturation Curve to preserve or emphasize the skeletal form of transient attacks.
