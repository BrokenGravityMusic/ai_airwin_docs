PurestEcho

A plugin providing four evenly spaced echoes with precise timing control, ideal for creating discrete echoes, delay lines, or unique effects.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay Time`: Adjusts the overall delay time for all taps.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Tap 1-4:
	+ Delay Time: Adjustable delay time for each of the four echoes, equally spaced in time.
		- Range: [insert text]
		- Type: [insert text]
	+ Volume: Sets the volume of each individual tap.
		- Range: [insert text]
		- Type: [insert text]
* Delay Time Slider: Adjusts the overall delay time for all echoes simultaneously, with abrupt changes suitable for automation.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Master Volume: Sets the overall volume of the echoes.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: [insert text]

Caveats:
The delay time slider is not smoothed to allow for abrupt frequency changes, making it ideal for automation rather than live adjustment.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal scenarios include:
* Discrete echo creation with no feedback
* Single slapback effect using the last tap
* Odd effects like increasing volume slapbacks or selective tap usage
* Creating a 90s-style tone by turning all taps on full and setting short delay times

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For optimal results, use the slider for automation to achieve abrupt frequency changes. Experiment with different tap configurations to find unique soundscapes.
