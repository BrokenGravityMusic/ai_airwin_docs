An optimized Airwindows echo plugin with four evenly spaced taps that can be used for a variety of delay and echo effects.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay Time`: Sets the overall delay time for all echoes simultaneously.
    + Range: 
    + Type: 
* `Tap Level 1-4`: Adjustable delay time for each of the four echoes, equally spaced in time.
    + Range: 
    + Type: 
* `Master Volume`: Sets the overall volume of the echoes.
    + Range: 
    + Type: 

Caveats:
The delay time slider is not smoothed to allow for abrupt frequency changes, making it ideal for automation rather than live adjustment.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal scenarios include discrete echo creation with no feedback, single slapback effect using the last tap, odd effects like increasing volume slapbacks or selective tap usage, and creating a 90s-style tone by turning all taps on full and setting short delay times.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For optimal results, use the slider for automation to achieve abrupt frequency changes. Experiment with different tap configurations to find unique soundscapes.
