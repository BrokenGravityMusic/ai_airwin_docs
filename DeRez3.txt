DeRez3


A plugin that uses Bezier curves to reconstruct lo-fi samples, creating a smooth and artifact-prone sound.


Key Controls and Settings:


* Rate: Influences the sampling rate and reconstruction process
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Dry/Wet Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:


* Using DeRez3 can create interesting artifacts that might be desirable or undesirable depending on the context.
* Bezier curves are used to smooth out lo-fi samples, which may not always produce the desired result.


Best Use Cases:


* Creating unique sounds for music production
* Experimenting with new sonic textures and styles


Tips on Optimal Settings:


* Play with different Rate settings to achieve varying degrees of smoothing and artifact creation.
* Adjust Rez levels to introduce gating behavior and alter the sound further.
