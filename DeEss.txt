Caveats:
Avoid overtriggering, as this can lead to unpleasant effects on unwanted frequencies. Use good taste when applying de-essing to avoid 'lisping' effects.

Best Use Cases:
Remove sibilance from vocals and instruments with harsh 's' and 't' sounds in a variety of audio contexts.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Crank up the effect level to plainly hear where it hits, then adjust the trigger sensitivity and other controls for optimal results. Template your settings to ensure consistent de-essing performance.
