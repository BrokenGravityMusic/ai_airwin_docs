Sidepass

A simple utility plugin, a highpass filter on the side channel for creating mono mixes.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Highpass Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the highpass filter (DC to 22K).
    + Range: 0-100
* `Threshold` / `Cutoff`: Sets the sensitivity of the highpass filter or adjusts the frequency cutoff of the highpass filter.
    + Range: N/A
* `Dry/Wet Mix`: Blend ratio between original and side-passed signal / Output gain control for the side channel.
    + Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:

* Not very fancy, but can be a useful tool for mono-making.
* Designed to work up the full range from subs to highs, so at full crank it'd be purely mono.
* Aware of sample rates, so adjustments may be necessary across different sampling frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for use in situations where a clear and distinct stereo image is desired:

* Mixing and mastering
* Surround sound production
* Music production

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the Highpass Control to taste to achieve the desired level of high-frequency reduction.
* Be mindful of sample rates when using Sidepass to maintain consistent performance.
* Use 0.1 setting for subtle mono-ification effect at high sample rates (e.g., 44.1K or 96K).
* Experiment with crank settings and dry/wet mix ratios to achieve desired balance between side-passed and original signal.
