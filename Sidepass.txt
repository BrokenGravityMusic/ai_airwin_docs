Sidepass

A highpass filter on the side channel, going up the full range from subs to highs.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Highpass Control`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the highpass filter.
	+ Range: 0-100 (0 = flat, 100 = full range)
	+ Note: Aware of sample rates to maintain consistent performance across different sampling frequencies.
* `Threshold`: Sets the sensitivity of the highpass filter.
* Dry/Wet Mix: Blend ratio between original and side-passed signal.

Caveats:

* Not very fancy, but can be a useful tool for mono-making.
* Designed to work up the full range from subs to highs, so at full crank it'd be purely mono.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for use in situations where a clear and distinct stereo image is desired, such as:

* Mixing and mastering
* Surround sound production
* Music production

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the Highpass Control to taste to achieve the desired level of high-frequency reduction.
* Be mindful of sample rates when using Sidepass to maintain consistent performance.
