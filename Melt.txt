Melt

A wobbly chorusy weird diffuse effect that utilizes a delay buffer with pitch-shifting and tonal modulation.
`Key Controls and Settings:`
* `Moving Average Delay`: A delayed moving average section, where start and end points can be read from the delay buffer.
    + Start and End Points: Control points for the moving average section.
    + Wobble Amount: Amplitude of wobble in the moving average section.
* `Pitch-Shifting`:
    + Pitch Shift Depth: Controls the amount of pitch-shifting applied to the delayed signal.
    + Wobble Amount (again): Controls the amount of tonal modulation and volume change while pitching.
* `Dry/Wet Mix`:
    + Dry Signal: Blend control for the dry signal mixed with the processed signal.
    + Wet Signal: Blend control for the processed signal mixed with the original dry signal.
`Best Use Cases:`
Ideal for creating strange retro ambience effects, or more traditional chorusy sounds. Can also be used on pads and other instruments to add dark and diffuse texture.
`Tips on Optimal Settings:`
* To create a chorusy sound, tighten the delay time and use moderate pitch-shift depth.
* For a darker, more diffuse effect, increase the delay time and wobble amount.
* Experiment with different settings to achieve unique textures and timbres.
