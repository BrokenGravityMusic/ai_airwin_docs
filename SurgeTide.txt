SurgeTide

A surge and flow dynamics plugin that simulates tidal forces in an audio mix, creating subtle yet powerful dynamic changes.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Surge Node`: Adjusts the compression threshold to squish sound on the beat.
	+ Tip: Start by adjusting until sound is slightly compressed.
* `Surge Rate`: Sets the speed of compression.
	+ Tip: Experiment with different settings to achieve a natural-sounding effect, finding a balance between slow and fast.
* `Compression Time Constants`: Three stacked time constants that control the dynamics response.
	+ No specific recommendation; setting will depend on mix content.

Caveats:

* Does not work well on isolated tracks or staccato drum patterns.
* May not work well on tracks with rapid dynamic changes.
* Requires careful setting to achieve desired effect.

Best Use Cases:

* Whole-mix dynamics control
* Subtle accentuation of low-end movement
* Level control and restraint on dense mix moments

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start by adjusting Surge Node until sound is slightly compressed.
* Experiment with different Surge Rate settings to achieve a natural-sounding effect.
* Pay attention to extreme low bass and adjust settings accordingly.
