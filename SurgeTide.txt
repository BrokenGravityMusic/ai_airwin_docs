SurgeTide

A surge and flow dynamics plugin that simulates tidal forces on a mix, accentuating low-end movement and subtlety controlling dynamics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Surge Node`: Adjusts the compression threshold to squash sound on the beat. Optimal setting: find the right balance between squishing away the sound and inverting the dynamics.
* `Surge Rate`: Sets the speed of the tidal force simulation. Optimal setting: adjust to achieve a subtle, natural-sounding effect.
* `Compression Time Constants`: Three stacked time constants that simulate wave-like behavior.

Caveats:
* Does not work well on isolated tracks, especially staccato drum tracks.
* Can be tricky to dial in due to its unique and often invisible effects.
* May not produce useful results on all types of mixes or sounds.

Best Use Cases:
* Subtle accentuation of mix low-end movement
* Restraint of dense mix moments for more consistent loudness
* Level control and subtlety boosting subs

Tips on Optimal Settings: 
* Start by adjusting the Surge Node to squash sound on the beat.
* Experiment with different Surge Rate settings to achieve a natural-sounding effect.
* Pay attention to extreme low bass and adjust settings accordingly.
