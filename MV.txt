MV (Dual-Mono Reverb)

A unique digital reverb with a custom allpass filter that uses bit shift increments, allowing for infinite sustain and bloom-like effects.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bit Shift Amount`: Selects the amount of gain change in 6 dB increments.
* `Feedback`: Sets the feedback level, which will be rounded down to the nearest available bit shift amount.
* `Bright Control`: Adjusts the degree of high-frequency roll-off using averaging output samples of the allpasses.
* `Regeneration Level`: Selects the regeneration level (full, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16).
* Size: controls the number of allpasses in the chain

Additional Features:

* Dual-mono operation allows for separate control of each channel's reverb tail.
* Infinite regeneration enables sustainable "bloom" effects without limiting or compressing the output.
* Gated reverb effect can be created by setting regeneration to zero, cleaning up the mix and then fading out.

Caveats:
Removing too many allpasses can result in a "nasty" sound. Infinite regenerations may cause runaway and require output trimming.

Best Use Cases:

* Sustain bloom-like effects
* Create ambiance generators or on auxes and submixes to add space and purity

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different regeneration levels, bit shift amounts, and bright control settings to achieve the desired reverb effect.
