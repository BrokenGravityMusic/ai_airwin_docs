Dual-mono reverb plugin based on BitShiftGain and Midiverb that uses bit shifts for allpasses, regeneration, and treble rolloff.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Bit Shift Amount`: Selects the amount of gain change in 6 dB increments.
	+ Used for regeneration and high-frequency roll-off.
* `Feedback`: Sets the feedback level for regeneration. The actual regeneration will be the nearest lower value to prevent reverb runaway.
* `Bright Control`: Adjusts the degree of treble rolloff, with 100% being no roll-off and 0% being full roll-off.
* `Regeneration Level`: Selects the regeneration level, with options for full, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 levels.

Additional Features:
* Dual-mono operation allows for separate control of each channel's reverb tail.
* Infinite regeneration enables sustainable "bloom" effects without limiting or compressing the output.

Best Use Cases:
Can be used as an ambiance generator or on auxes and submixes to add space and purity.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Bright Control for optimal high-frequency response, and Regeneration Level for desired sustain.
