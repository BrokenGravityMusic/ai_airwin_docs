CrunchyGrooveWear

A plugin for adding edge, distortion, and crunch to audio signals, producing a treble-eroding effect with a different operating principle than normal EQs.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Dry/Wet Control: Adjusts the intensity of the effect in four stages (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0), creating a "treble-eroded" quality at halfway engaged stages
	+ Stage 1: A subtle effect with minimal impact on high frequencies
	+ Stage 2-4: Increasing levels of treble erosion and energy boost
* Intensity Control (not explicitly mentioned): Adjusts how much slew averaging is applied in each stage

Caveats:
The plugin has an overshoot effect at full intensity, similar to the original GrooveWear. Adjusting the dry/wet control can produce unexpected results due to the way the effect kicks in.

Best Use Cases:
Achieving a "vinyl warmth" effect
Adding zing and character to audio signals
Creating a crunchy, treble-hyped sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For extreme crunch, use intermediate dry/wet settings (0.25, 0.5, 0.75) to achieve the desired level of high-frequency erosion.
Cranking the dry/wet control to full intensity can produce a unique, exciter-like effect with no pre-echo.
