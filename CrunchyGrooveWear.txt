CrunchyGrooveWear

A plugin for adding edge, distortion, and crunch to audio signals by averaging/smoothing the rate of change of the signal. Produces a treble-eroding effect with a different operating principle than normal EQs.

* `Dry/Wet Control`: Adjusts the intensity of the effect in four stages (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0). Intermediate settings can create a "treble-eroded" quality.
	+ Range: 0.25 to 1.0
* `Intensity Control`: Specifies how much slew averaging to apply (acts like a frequency range control)
	+ Range: not specified

Caveats:
The plugin has an overshoot effect at full intensity, similar to the original GrooveWear. Adjusting the dry/wet control can produce unexpected results due to the way the effect kicks in.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding edge and distortion to audio signals
* Creating a "vinyl warmth" effect
* Seeking fake zip of an interesting color

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For maximum crunch, use 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0 as intermediate settings. For extreme crunch and distortion, fully crank the Dry/Wet control to 1.0.
