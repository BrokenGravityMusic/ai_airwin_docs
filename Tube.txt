Tube

A tube style SoundBetterIzer using a new algorithm for analog modeling, designed to make audio "HUGE" with a simple distortion algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Crank`: Adjusts the level of distortion.
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Effect: Soft-clip at 0, extreme distortion at 1
* `Linearity`: Adjusts the linearity of the distortion, with lower values resulting in more complex and linear behavior.
	+ Range: -100 to 100
	+ Effect: Changes the type of distortion from soft-clip with a clean center region (0) to inputSample â€“ inputSample*fabs(inputSample), scaled and gain-adjusted
* `Pre-boost`: A carefully calculated pre-boost that sets the RMS loudness of a triangle wave to match the RMS loudness of a sine wave at full crank.

Caveats:
The plugin is designed for heavy-handed use, but may not be suitable for subtle or nuanced applications. It's also not ideal for handling problem aliasing cases, but effective for creating tubey midrange lushness.

Best Use Cases:
Adding warmth and character to audio tracks, mixes, or mastering sessions. Creating a distinctive sound that's characteristic of the Airwindows house sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a moderate level of distortion (around 50-60% crank) and adjust from there based on your desired tone. Experiment with different linearity settings to find the right balance between warmth and clarity. Use the pre-boost feature judiciously, as it can add significant energy to your audio.
