Tube


A tube style SoundBetterIzer using a new algorithm for analog modeling.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Crank`: Adjusts the level of distortion. Can be set to zero for soft-clip behavior, or cranked up for more extreme distortion.
    + Range: 0 to 100
    + Effect: Increases linearity, making it simpler or more complex and linear.
* `Linearity`: Adjusts the linearity of the distortion, with lower values resulting in more complex and linear behavior.
    + Range: -100 to 100
    + Effect: Changes the type of distortion from soft-clip with a clean center region (0) to inputSample â€“ inputSample*fabs(inputSample), scaled and gain-adjusted (full crank).
* `Pre-boost`: A carefully calculated pre-boost that sets the RMS loudness of a triangle wave (not unlike music content) to match the RMS loudness of a sine wave at full crank.
    + Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
This plugin is designed for heavy-handed use, but may not be suitable for subtle or nuanced applications. It's not ideal for handling problem aliasing cases, but effective for creating tubey midrange lushness.


Best Use Cases:

* Adding warmth and character to audio tracks, mixes, or mastering sessions.
* Creating a distinctive sound that's characteristic of the Airwindows house sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a moderate level of distortion (around 50-60% crank) and adjust from there based on your desired tone. Experiment with different linearity settings to find the right balance between warmth and clarity.
