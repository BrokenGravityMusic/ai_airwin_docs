	+ Turning up adds more color and definition.
* Level: Sets the overall gain and presence of the console simulation.

Caveats:
* Bus Saturation above 70% can introduce audible distortion.
* Overdriving the Drive control can lead to an unnatural, over-warm sound.
* Be cautious when adjusting the compression threshold and ratio, as this can affect the overall sound.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for simulating a vintage console system in mixing environments or mastering workflows where a warmer sound is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with moderate gain settings and adjust as needed to avoid overloading the plugin.
Use the EQ bands to carve out space in the mix, rather than boosting specific frequencies.
Adjust the compressor threshold and ratio carefully to achieve a balanced dynamic response.
