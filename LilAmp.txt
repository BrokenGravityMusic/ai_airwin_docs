LilAmp
================


A tiny amp simulator with low gain, ideal for clean, articulate effects or highlighting treble and midrange.

Key Controls and Settings:


* `Gain:` Adjusts the overall volume of the plugin.
	+ Range: Lower values produce a cleaner sound, while higher values increase loudness.
	+ Type: Slider control
* `Dry/Wet Control:` A two-stage control that allows adjusting the mix between the cab sim and amp sim sounds.
	+ Stage 1: Cab Sim Dry/Wet - Controls the amount of dry cab sim signal mixed with the wet signal.
	+ Stage 2: Amp Sim Dry/Wet - Controls the amount of dry amp sim signal mixed with the wet signal.

Caveats:
LilAmp is designed to be a clean, articulate effect and may not produce heavy saturation or gain.

Best Use Cases:
* Clean, articulate leads
* Highlighting treble and midrange in rhythm guitar
* Creating a loud, confined sound effect (e.g., snare drum)
* Adding a Stonesy vibe to rhythm guitar

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different gain levels to find the right balance for your sound.
* Use the dry/wet control to blend the cab sim and amp sim signals to taste.
* Try using LilAmp as a starting point and morphing it directly into the desired sound, rather than trying to mimic a specific literal amp.
