A tiny amp simulator with low gain, designed for clean, articulate effects or highlighting treble and midrange.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Gain: Adjusts the overall gain of the amplifier.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: Control
* Dry/Wet Control:
    + Stage 1 (Cab Sim): A special control that provides one stage of dry/wet mixing for the cab simulation.
    + Stage 2 (Amp Sim): Another stage controls the amp simulation.

Best Use Cases:

* Clean, articulate effects or highlighting treble and midrange.
* Leads: Enhance treble and midrange for a clear, articulate sound.
* Snare: Convert snare into a loud, confined whack.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different gain levels to find the right balance for your sound. Use the dry/wet control to blend the cab sim and amp sim signals to taste.
