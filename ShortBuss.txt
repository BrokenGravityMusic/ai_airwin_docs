ShortBuss

A plugin that chases second harmonic to add or remove it, providing an asymmetry effect by finding imbalance in the waveform.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Asymmetry:` Adjusts the level of asymmetry in the waveform.
	+ Range: 0% to ?
	+ Type: Control
* `Second Harmonic:` Toggles on/off the effect of chasing second harmonic.
	+ Range: On/Off
	+ Type: Toggle
* `Reverse:` Toggles on/off the reverse mode, which fights even harmonics.
	+ Range: On/Off
	+ Type: Toggle

Caveats:
The effect can be subtle and may require experimentation to hear its impact. Not an EQ or saturation plugin.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding warmth and interest to bass-heavy mixes
* Conditioning effects for guitar going into heavy distortion
* Creating unique bass-conditioner effects

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a low Asymmetry value and gradually increase to taste. Experiment with both Second Harmonic and Reverse modes to achieve desired results.
