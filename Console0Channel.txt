Console Zero

A plugin that creates a unique sound by using minimalist processing techniques, focusing on bit-shifting, simple averaging, and saturation to preserve the original "untouched mantissa" (the part of an audio signal that contains the actual audio information).

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bit Shifter:` A control for shifting bits without altering the mantissa
    + Range: -24 dB to 0 dB
    + Type: Linear
* `Simple Average:` A control for filtering using simple averaging
    + Range: Off to 1.00
    + Type: Linear
* `Saturation Level:` A control for setting the saturation level
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: Linear

Best Use Cases:
This plugin will appeal to users who want a unique sound that prioritizes minimalism and preserving the original audio information. It's ideal for those who want to create mixes that sound like life, not like a DAW.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To get the most out of Console Zero, run your DAW at 96k or higher, manage groups of tracks as a whole (think in aggregates), and use high track counts to take advantage of the averaging and filtering.
