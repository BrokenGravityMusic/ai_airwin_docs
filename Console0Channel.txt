Console Zero

A plugin that creates a distinct sonic character by limiting math operations to just 8 across the entire mix buss and relying heavily on bit-shifting, allowing for a more "life-like" sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bit Shifter:` Adjusts level and pan without altering the mantissa
	+ Range: N/A (bit-shifting based)
	+ Type: Discrete
* `Simple Averager:` Filters the mix with one operation and a bit shift, preserving original gain
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Simple average

Caveats:

Limited expressiveness; not suitable for precise EQing or compression. High sample rates (96k or higher) are recommended.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing with high track counts and a focus on broad-stroke adjustments
* Creating mixes that prioritize the raw, untouched signal above all else

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Run at 96k or 192k to take advantage of averaging and filtering
* Think in aggregates and manage groups of tracks as a whole rather than individual tracks
