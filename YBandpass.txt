YBandpass

A band-pass filter plugin that can be used for tone-shaping and texture-varying filtering.

Key Controls and Settings:

* ResEdge: Adjusts the resonance of the filter, ranging from a smooth to edgy sound. Higher values amplify high-frequency content, while lower values produce a smoother sound.
	+ Default value: 0
	+ Range: 0 to 100
* Freq (Frequency): Sets the center frequency of the bandpass filter.
	+ Default value: 500 Hz
	+ Range: 20 Hz to 20000 Hz

Caveats:
None noted.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for tone-shaping and texture-varying filtering. Can be used to create unique sound effects, such as a "walkie-talkie" tone on voice recordings.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve the closest traditional biquad response, set ResEdge to 0.1. This will produce a slightly warm sound when compared to other YBandpass filters.
