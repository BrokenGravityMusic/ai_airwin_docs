BiquadDouble

A cascaded biquad filter providing steeper roll-off before resonance.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Resonance`: Controls the peak frequency response of the filter.
	+ Range: "impossibly high" to full bandwidth
* `Cutoff Steepness`: Sets the steepness of the low-pass roll-off.
	+ Note: Stacked filters allow for twice as much cutoff steepness before resonance.

Best Use Cases:

* Use as a basic filter for tone shaping. Ideal scenario: simple effects and plugin creation where precise settings are required.
* Tone shaping in situations where a simple biquad filter is insufficient. Ideal for finding the "butter zone" between too shallow and too resonant responses.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Dial in correct settings for desired tone.
* Consider stacking two Biquad instances instead of using this plugin, but note that setting both the same may not yield optimal results.
* Experiment with resonance settings to find the desired tone.
* Adjust cutoff frequency and gain to achieve the best results.
* Be cautious when using rapid automation due to potential interactions with BiquadDouble's implementation.
