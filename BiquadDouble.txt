BiquadDouble

A cascaded biquad filter providing steeper roll-off before resonance.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff Frequency`: Adjusts the point at which the filter starts to attenuate frequencies.
	+ Range: Not specified
* `Resonance`: Controls the peakiness of the filter's response, ranging from "impossibly high" to full bandwidth.
	+ Note: Stacked filters allow for twice as much cutoff steepness before resonance.
* `Filter Type`: Not applicable, as this is a stacked biquad filter.

Caveats:
May not cooperate with rapid automation due to its efficient but least cooperative design and internal Console mixing system.
Tone is "expanded" inside an internal Console mixing system, different from standard biquad filters.

Best Use Cases:
Use for tone shaping in situations where a simple biquad filter is insufficient. Ideal scenario: simple effects and plugin creation where precise settings are required.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Dial in correct settings for desired tone.
Consider stacking two Biquad instances instead of using this plugin, but note that setting both the same may not yield optimal results.
Experiment with resonance settings to find the desired tone.
Adjust cutoff frequency and gain to achieve the best results.
