BussColors4

A console emulator plugin that works at any sample rate (44K, 96K, and 192K), producing a similar sound to its predecessors.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Model Selection:` Choose from Dark, Rock, Lush, Vibe, Holo, Punch, Steel, or Tube
	+ Each model has its own unique tone characteristics.
* Drive Control: Adjust the drive level to shape the tone
* Dry/Wet Control: Blend the plugin's output with the original sound

Caveats:
The plugin uses a dynamic convolution model, which means it's not an exact clone of the source impulses.

Best Use Cases:
Use BussColors4 for adding character and warmth to your sound. Experiment with different models to find the perfect tone color for your music.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the drive level to control the amount of saturation and distortion. Use the dry/wet control to blend the plugin's output with the original sound for a more subtle effect.
