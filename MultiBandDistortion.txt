MultiBandDistortion

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Stability`: A slider controlling the level of stability in the effect. Lower values result in a more choppy and unpredictable sound.
	+ Range: 0-100
	+ Type: Slider
* `Band Gain`: Sets the gain for each band (see below).
	+ Range: -20 to +20 dB
	+ Type: Knob
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Slider
* `Band1-4`: Separate distortion control for four frequency bands (low, mid-low, high-mid, and high).
	+ Range: -20 to +20 dB
	+ Type: Knob

Best Use Cases:
* Creating extreme, high-energy effects in electronic dance music (EDM) or other genres that require a heavily distorted sound.
* Experimenting with unconventional sounds and textures in audio production.
* Achieving a 'slammed', heavily distorted sound similar to certain pedals.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* To achieve the most extreme distortion effect, turn Stability down to a low value and adjust the band controls (Band1-4) to target specific frequency ranges.
