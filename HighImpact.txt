HighImpact

Distorts audio without making it fatter, combining a distortion and anti-distortion circuit to reshape the transfer function.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Aggro:` A knob that controls the level of distortion and raspiness in the output sound.
	+ Range: Unknown (distorts quiet samples minimally, while amplifying medium samples significantly)
	+ Type: Control
* `Distortion Level:` A single knob for controlling the level of distortion, allowing for subtle or extreme effects.
	+ Range: Unknown (can be used to add character and aggression to percussive noises or other audio elements)
	+ Type: Control

Caveats:
The plugin is designed to be used intentionally and creatively, rather than as a preset or magic solution. Its purpose is to add character and aggression to audio elements.

Best Use Cases:
Adding character and aggression to percussive noises or other audio elements.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Tailor the use of HighImpact to the specific needs of each project, using it to add subtle or extreme effects as needed.
