Coils

Models distortion found in transformers by saturating extreme highs and lows, leaving midrange untouched.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Top Control: Increases distortion of high frequencies
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Middle Control (DC Bias): Adds second harmonics to the signal when less saturated
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* Dry/Wet Control: Blends distorted signal with original audio
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding subtle transformer-style distortion to specific frequency ranges, or for emulating classic console sounds. Use to add transformer-like distortion to individual tracks or submixes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To get a subtle effect, keep top control low. To increase distortion, raise top control. Adjust middle control to balance DC bias and second harmonics.
