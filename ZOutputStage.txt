ZOutputStage

A plugin that applies output clipping from Emu e6400 style Z filters, similar to an exciter but using special filtering to get "frizz" on the edges of clipped sounds.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Level`: Adjusts the overall level of the effect.
	+ Type: Fader
* `Distortion`: Sets the amount of distortion applied by the plugin. Values above 0.1 produce a distorted sound, similar to the Emu e6400's Z filters.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Slider
* `Output Level`: Reduces the output level of the plugin, as it produces a hot signal.
	+ Range: -10dB to +10dB

Best Use Cases:
Adding energy and grind to synth waves, particularly in drum and bass genres. Enhancing the sound of digital audio productions to make them more similar to analog recordings.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a low Distortion setting (around 0.1) and gradually increase it to taste. Keep an eye on your Output Level setting to avoid clipping and distortion. Apply this plugin after other effects or processing stages to get the best results.
