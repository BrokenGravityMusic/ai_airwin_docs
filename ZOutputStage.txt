Exciter

A plugin that adds transients "pop" by distorting specific frequency bands.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Frequency`: Select the frequency band to be distorted.
* `Effect Amount`: Control the intensity of the distortion effect.
* `Distortion Type`: Soft clip distortion, mimicking a sin() function.

Caveats:
Turning up the Effect Amount too high can result in obvious crunch, whereas real-world examples would use much lower levels.

Key Controls and Settings (continued):
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original

Best Use Cases:
Adding grit and energy to synth waves or other digital sounds.
Enhancing transients and creating a "frizz" effect on clipped sounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with subtle adjustments and fine-tune the Effect Amount for a more natural sound.
Experiment with different Frequency settings to find the right balance between grit and tone.
