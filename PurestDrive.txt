PurestDrive


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Intensity`: A slider control (0 to 1) that adjusts the amount of saturation applied.
* `Apply`: A dynamic parameter that combines the previous dry sample with the saturated input sample, affecting the amount of saturation based on frequency content.
* `Dry Sample`: The previous input sample is kept around and used in conjunction with the saturated input sample.

Caveats:
If the input gets super hot, PurestDrive may end up subtracting a little dry from the saturated input sample.


Best Use Cases: Ideal for situations where a subtle, tone-pure saturation effect is desired. Suitable for use on dense solid material in tracks and buses to maintain clarity and definition.


Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Intensity control to achieve the desired level of saturation.
Experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance between saturation and dry signal preservation.
Use PurestDrive as a complement to other plugins, rather than a primary effect processor.
