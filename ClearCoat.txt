ClearCoat

A bright, airy ambiance generator for adding clarity and spatiality to individual tracks or submixes.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Top Slider:` Selects a pre-defined reverb setting (17 options available)
    + Range: 1-17
    + Type: Setting selection
* `Bottom Slider:` Dry/Wet control (0-100%)
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: Blend control

Caveats:
May not work as intended at extreme sample rates. SubTight refinement may cause issues if not scaled correctly.

Best Use Cases:

Adding ambiance to individual tracks or submixes, creating a "nearfield reflections" effect for vocals or drums, and using as a Verb 1 in a mixing chain with another reverb plugin (e.g. kCathedral) as Verb 2.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start by selecting a setting and adjusting the dry/wet slider to taste. Experiment with different settings to find the right tone color for your mix. Use the SubTight refinement to add brightness or cut low frequencies in the feedback path.
