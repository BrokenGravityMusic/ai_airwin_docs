ZNotch2

A phaser-style filter based on the Emu e6400 Ultra phaser, featuring coefficient interpolation.

	+ Range: 
	+ Type: interpolation method (assumed)
* Filter type: selects the type of notch filter (e.g. low-pass, high-pass)

Caveats:
Does not have exact same tone as original ZNotch when modulating controls.
May use more CPU than original ZNotch due to coefficient recalculation.

Best Use Cases:
Electronic music production, particularly DnB and similar styles.
Creating dynamic phaser effects in motion.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust settings for desired sound and motion.
Experiment with different modulation techniques to achieve unique effects.
