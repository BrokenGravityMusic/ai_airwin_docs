A two-stage supersonic filter for use in digital mixes, designed to clean up top-end frequencies.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Number of stages:` Choose between one (Lite) or two (Medium) stages of filtering.
    + Range: 1-2
    + Type: Selection
* `Frequency response:` The filters start at a higher frequency to preserve more high-end content.
    + Range: Adjustable (default is approximately 20k Hz)
    + Type: Frequency cutoff

Caveats:

* Using multiple instances may cause rolling off highs, unlike the full version.
* Not brickwalls; can be used throughout the mix before and after nonlinear plugins to suppress ultrasonic frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
Use in digital mixes where ultrasonic frequencies need to be suppressed, especially when dealing with aliasing or distortion issues.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Apply a cleaner filter by using Ultrasonic Lite in areas where subtle high-end reduction is needed.
* Experiment with staggered filter placement in Medium version for optimal results.
