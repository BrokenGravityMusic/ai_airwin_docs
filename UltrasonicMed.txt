UltrasonicMed

A two-stage supersonic filter for high sample rate mixes, designed to clean up top-end frequencies in digital mixes.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Number of stages: Choose between one (Lite) or two (Medium) stages of filtering.
	+ Range: 1-2
	+ Type: Selectable
* Filter placement: The filters start at a higher frequency to preserve more high-end content, with the Medium version subtly staggering the placement for a more natural sound.
	+ Range: Adjustable
	+ Type: Staggered (Medium)
* Frequency response: Starts at a higher frequency than Ultrasonic Lite.
	+ Range: Adjustable

Caveats:

* Using multiple instances may cause rolling off highs, unlike the full version.
* Not brickwalls; can be used throughout the mix before and after nonlinear plugins to suppress ultrasonic frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
Use in digital mixes where ultrasonic frequencies need to be suppressed, especially when dealing with aliasing or distortion issues.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Apply a cleaner filter by using Ultrasonic Lite in areas where subtle high-end reduction is needed.
* Use multiple instances of Ultrasonic Lite for gentle, distributed aliasing suppression across the mix.
* Strategically place instances to control aliasing and unwanted high-frequency content.
