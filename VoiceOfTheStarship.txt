A deep noise tone source capable of generating brownian-motion noise without excessive DC offset.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Algorithm`: Generates random noise wander with equally positive and negative amounts being added or subtracted.
	+ Adjusting the algorithm can change the noise's bassy rumble quality, making it revert to zero more often for a less bassy tone.
* `Dry/Wet`: Blend and darken underlying sounds with the generated noise.
* `Distance`: Applies to both dry and wet signals, controlling their balance.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for generating deep dark noise, subsonic rumble, or algorithmic background ambience in audio streams.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjusting the Dry/Wet balance and Distance control can help achieve desired noise levels and tonalities. Experimenting with the Algorithm can produce varying degrees of bassy rumble or dark, subsonic tones.
