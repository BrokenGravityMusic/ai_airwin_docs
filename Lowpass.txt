Lowpass

Function Overview: Mixing EQ with treble rolloff capabilities, suitable for deepening tone and adding textural modifications.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Cutoff: Controls the frequency at which the rolloff occurs.
* Soft/Hard (or Loose/Tight): A unique parameter that controls how the IIR filters are fed audio. Adjusting this parameter can alter the tone-character modification, providing two different textures at deeper cut settings.
	+ Range: Center position has no effect; offset from center changes tone-character modification.
	+ Type: Interleaved IIR filter design.
* Dry/Wet: Allows you to blend the original and processed signals.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding depth and coloration to huge synth pads or orchestral tracks. Also useful for texture shaping in various musical contexts.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* For a subtle treble rolloff, adjust the soft/hard control towards the center position.
* To accentuate the tone-character modification, offset the soft/hard parameter away from its center position.
* Balance the dry/wet control to suit your desired level of processing.
