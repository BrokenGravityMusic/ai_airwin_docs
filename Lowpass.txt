Lowpass

A mixing EQ filter that deepens the tone, adds a gloss, and provides textural modifications.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff`: Controls the frequency at which the rolloff occurs.
* `Soft/Hard (or Loose/Tight)`: A unique parameter that controls how the IIR filters are fed audio. Adjusting this parameter can alter the tone-character modification, providing two different textures at deeper cut settings. 
	+ Range: Offsets from center position provide different tones.
* `Dry/Wet`: Allows you to blend the original and processed signals.

Caveats:
Not suitable for mastering requirements; intended as a mixing tool. Has unique behavior compared to traditional EQs due to its interleaved IIR filter design.

Best Use Cases
Ideal for adding depth and coloration to huge synth pads or orchestral tracks. Also useful for texture shaping in various musical contexts.

Tips on Optimal Settings
* For a subtle treble rolloff, adjust the soft/hard control towards the center position.
* To accentuate the tone-character modification, offset the soft/hard parameter away from its center position.
* Balance the dry/wet control to suit your desired level of processing.
