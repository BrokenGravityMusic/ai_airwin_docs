Ultrasonic and Hypersonic plugins by Airwindows

insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter:` 
	+ Range: adjustable filter cutoff
	+ Type: 14th-order Butterworth filter (Ultrasonic) or more complex filter stages (Hypersonic)
* `Resolution:` 32-bit floats used for audio math, but internal buss uses higher precision to maintain accuracy
	+ Hypersonic uses a high-resolution buss (5,366,870,912 times better than standard 32-bit float)

Caveats:
* Ultrasonic might not suit those who prefer a bright and upfront soundstage
* Hypersonic's extra complexity and resolution may be overkill for some users

Best Use Cases:
* Ultrasonic: adds warmth and depth to sound; suitable for mastering and mixing
* Hypersonic: provides better detail and accuracy than Ultrasonic, but with increased computational requirements

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust filter cutoff according to desired soundstage and balance
* Consider using Hypersonic's high-resolution buss for improved audio quality
