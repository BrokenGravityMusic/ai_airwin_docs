Monitoring

Settings for extreme monitoring situations:

* Not Just Another Dither: 24-bit and 16-bit dither options
* PeaksOnly, SlewOnly, SubsOnly: switch between peak, slew, and sub-only monitoring options
* Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original (range: 0% to 100%)
* Mono and Side: utility plugins for quick mono check

Monitoring Options:

* Vinyl: traditional lathe electronics-style roll-off
    + Bandwidth limiting: ultra-broad bandpass filtering
* Aurat: narrow bandpass filtering, simulating output of one-driver mix check speakers

Crossfeed Algorithms:

* Cans A: subtle crossfeed for mixing and easy listening (uses allpasses from PeaksOnly)
    + Range: 0% to 100%
* Cans B: more obvious crossfeed for late-night checks or when fatigued
    + Range: 0% to 100%
* Cans C: stronger, but still normal crossfeed algorithm
    + Range: 0% to 100%
* Cans D: 'headphones energy redistributor' that attacks exaggerated stereo while maintaining some characteristics of Peaks monitoring
    + Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:
Monitor extreme signal levels, use with headphones for accurate mixing and mastering.
