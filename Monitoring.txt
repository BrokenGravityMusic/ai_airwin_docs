Settings:

* Bit Depth: 24-bit and 16-bit options
* Not Just Another Dither (24-bit and 16-bit dither): enabled by default
* Monitoring options:
	+ PeaksOnly, SlewOnly, SubsOnly: extreme monitoring situations
* Utilities:
	+ Mono and Side: quick mono check
* Vinyl, Aurat, and Phone options:
	+ Bandwidth limiting: ultra-broad bandpass filtering (Vinyl)
	+ Narrower bandpass filtering (Aurat): simulates output of one-driver mix check speakers
	+ Very narrow bandpass filtering (Phone): simulates output of cellphone speakers
* Cans A and B crossfeed algorithms:
	+ Uses allpasses from PeaksOnly to blur and extend stereo content
	+ Localizes stereo information while hinting at peak monitoring cues
	+ Two modes available: subtle (Cans A) and more obvious (Cans B)
* Cans C and D crossfeed algorithms:
	+ Cans C: stronger, but still normal crossfeed algorithm
	+ Cans D: 'headphones energy redistributor' that attacks exaggerated stereo while maintaining some characteristics of Peaks monitoring
