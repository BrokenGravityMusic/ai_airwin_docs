SlewOnly

A mix check plugin that shows only the extreme highs, producing a super-bright sound with zero latency.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `On/Off`: Switch SlewOnly on/off.
* `Dual Pole Filtering`: Use multiple instances of SlewOnly to apply two-pole filtering for stereo imaging and clarity enhancement
    + Type: On/Off toggle or instance count

Caveats:
Switching back to normal sound after using SlewOnly may result in an incredibly dull sound due to its brightening effect. Rest your ears for a moment before resuming work when switching back.

Best Use Cases:
Use at the end of your master buss to check the overall mix and make necessary adjustments, or to hear what your 2-buss chain did to the sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Add multiple instances for stereo imaging and clarity enhancement. Be cautious not to overload SlewOnly, as it can lead to loss of groove and introduction of unwanted noise.
