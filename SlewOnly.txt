SlewOnly

A mix check plugin that shows only the extreme highs, producing a super-bright sound with zero latency and no pre-ring or post-ring.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `On/Off`: Switch SlewOnly on/off.
* `Dual Pole Filtering`: Use multiple instances of SlewOnly to apply two-pole filtering for stereo imaging and clarity enhancement.

Caveats:
Switching back to the normal sound after using SlewOnly may result in a dull sound. Rest your ears for a moment before resuming work, and be cautious not to overload SlewOnly as it can lead to loss of groove and introduction of unwanted noise.

Best Use Cases:
Use at the end of your master buss to check the overall mix and make necessary adjustments, or ideal for mixing and mastering when going for "commercially loud" volumes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Add multiple instances for stereo imaging and clarity enhancement. Do not switch back to normal sound immediately after using SlewOnly, as it will sound incredibly dull.
