BrightAmbience

A plugin for creating very bright gated reverbs with a distinct sound that differs from convolution reverbs.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet`: Blend control for mixing original and reverb sound.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Decay`: Adjust the decay time (note: will not help with CPU hungriness).
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Sustain`: Adjust the sustain level, tied to maximum sample delay. Higher sample rates yield shorter sustains and denser shininess.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Sample Rate`: Higher sample rates (e.g., 96K) will give you shorter sustains and denser shininess.

Best Use Cases:

* Apply to signals that benefit from a bright, shiny halo effect.
* Ideal for creating unique special effects or adding distinctive reverb tone to audio.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with sustain control to balance CPU usage and desired effect.
* Higher sample rates may yield better results due to shorter sustains and denser shininess.
* Adjust dry/wet balance to taste, use mostly dry and add the reverb's coloration as needed.
