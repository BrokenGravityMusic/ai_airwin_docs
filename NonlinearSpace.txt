NonlinearSpace

A flexible reverb plugin with filter controls and acoustic space simulation in the loops.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Nonlinearity: Affects sound sustain; can be used to make louder sounds sustain longer or less.
	+ To sustain sounds longer, set nonlinearity to "increase" and feed consistent loudness.
	+ To sustain sounds less, set nonlinearity to "decrease".
* Sample Rate: Controls buffer lengths; shorter buffers create tighter spaces.
	+ Set to 44.1K for a small space or 96K for a large stadium-like sound.

Caveats:
Nonlinearity control may require consistent loudness input.
Using inappropriate settings can result in unusual and interesting sounds.

Best Use Cases:
Adding ambiance to tracks with sparse content (e.g., snare track).
Creating reverb beds that don't decay over time.
Simulating large spaces or stadium-like environments.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with nonlinearity settings to achieve the desired sound sustain effect.
Adjust sample rate buffer lengths to suit your desired space size and ambiance.
