kPlateB

A plate reverb plugin with a unique algorithm and topology, generating a 3x3 Householder matrix for allpasses and a 5x5 Householder matrix for delays.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Size:` Controls the size of the reverb space, affecting the decay time and overall sound. Range: [insert text]

* `Width:` Sets the stereo image width, from mono to wide stereo. Range: [insert text]
* `Mix:` Blends the wet signal with the dry input. Range: 0-100%
* Reverb Time: Adjusts the length of the reverb tail. Range: 0.1-10 seconds

Caveats:
Due to its unique algorithm, kPlateB's sound may not be directly comparable to other plate reverbs or even the same reverb in a different setting.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding ambiance and space to mix elements
* Creating a unique, lush atmosphere for vocals or instruments
* Enhancing the sense of depth and dimensionality in a mix

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Size settings to find the perfect balance between decay time and sound quality. Adjust Damping to taste, but be cautious of over-dampening which can lead to a washed-out sound. Use Width to create an interesting stereo image or blend into mono for a more intimate feel.
