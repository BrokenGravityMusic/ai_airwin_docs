Caveats:
Due to its unique algorithm, kPlateB's sound may not be directly comparable to other plate reverbs or even the same reverb in a different setting.
Adjusting controls may result in unpredictable changes to the overall sound.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding ambiance and space to mix elements
* Creating a unique, lush atmosphere for vocals or instruments
* Enhancing the sense of depth and dimensionality in a mix

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Size settings to find the perfect balance between decay time and sound quality.
Adjust Damping to taste, but be cautious of over-dampening which can lead to a washed-out sound.
Use Width to create an interesting stereo image or blend into mono for a more intimate feel.
