A highpass/lowpass shelf filter with a unique algorithmic implementation, offering adjustable frequency response with an increasing slope.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Nodes`: Adjusts the number of filter nodes, affecting the EQ point and tone.
    + Range: Stepped values
    + Type: Algorithmically controlled
* `Inv/Wet`: A dual-control setting for highpassing or lowpassing, acting as a shelving control on the filter.
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: Balanced signal blend

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding clarity and depth to audio signals, particularly in desk filtering applications. Suitable for use in Console versions of Console Zero and future iterations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with node values to fine-tune the EQ point and tone.
* Adjust the Inv/Wet control to balance highpassing or lowpassing levels according to your desired shelving effect.
* Use cascading multiple instances of the filter for increased effect in mastering and mixing applications.
