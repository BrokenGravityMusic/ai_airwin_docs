Doublelay

A plugin that takes Stereo Doubler's pitch-shifting algorithm and adds independent delays and feedback to create an immersive spatial effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Pitch Shifter:` Adjusts the pitch of the audio in both channels.
	+ Type: Frequency-based pitch shift
* Delay L/R Taps:
	+ Range: 0 ms to maximum delay time (dependent on system)
	+ Type: Independent delays for left and right channels
* Feedback Ratio:
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Direct feedback with a Golden Ratio value of 0.618, and inverse/crossfeed feedback
* Crossfeed Amount:
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Controls the amount of crossfeed between channels

Caveats:

* Excessive feedback can lead to infinite loop or color-smeared audio trails.
* This plugin is designed for creating spatial effects, not filling up large spaces like reverb.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding ambience, thickening vocals, or creating an 'echojam' effect in stereo with two taps where the echoes are also pitch shifts.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different feedback ratios and crossfeed amounts to achieve the desired spatial effect.
* Adjust the delay times to create a sense of space and distance between tracks.
