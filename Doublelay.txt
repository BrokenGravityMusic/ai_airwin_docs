Doublelay

A plugin that adds independent delays and feedback to the StereoDoubler's pitch-shifting algorithm, creating an immersive spatial effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Pitch Shifter:` Adjusts the pitch of the audio in both channels.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Pitch-shifting algorithm
* `Delay L/R Taps:` Sets the delay time for the left and right channels independently.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Delay time control
* `Feedback Ratio:` Sets the ratio for direct (pitch-shifting) and inverse/crossfeed feedback, using the Golden Ratio (0.618...).
	+ Range: 0 to 1.0
	+ Type: Feedback ratio control
* `Crossfeed Amount:` Controls the amount of crossfeed between channels.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Crossfeed control

Best Use Cases:

* Thicken vocals and instruments.
* Create an "echojam" effect in stereo with two taps that are also pitch shifts.
* Use one side as a short delay and the other side as a long delay to create depth.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different feedback ratios and crossfeed amounts to achieve the desired spatial effect.
* Adjust the delay times to create a sense of space and distance between tracks.
