Hermepass

A mastering highpass filter that allows setting by ear only.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff Frequency`: A 0-1 slider controlling the cutoff frequency of the highpass filter.
    + Range: 0 to 1
    + Type: Slider
* `Slope Control`: Continuously adjusts the highpass slope using up to six poles (staggered), allowing smooth adjustment of how many poles and how steep the slope.
    + Pole Count: Adjusts the number of poles used in the filtering process.
    + Dry/Wet Control: Internally adjusts the dry/wet ratio for each pole added.

Caveats:
* Depending on settings, transparent cutting of extreme low frequencies may give rise to higher peaks. Gain stage or use limiting/clipping as needed.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mastering and sound balancing applications where tonality retention is crucial while reshaping extreme lows.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Set controls around the middle of their travel for useful results.
* Be cautious of increased peaks when cutting extreme low frequencies. Adjust gain levels or use limiting/clipping as necessary to prevent excessive peak levels.
