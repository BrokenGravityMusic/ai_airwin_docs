Hermepass

A mastering highpass filter that allows setting by ear only.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff Frequency`: A 0-1 slider controlling the cutoff frequency of the highpass filter (use your ears).
	+ Range: 0 to 1
* `Slope Control`: A 0-1 slider controlling the slope of the highpass filter, with continuous adjustment using up to six poles.
	+ Pole Count: Adjusts the number of poles used in the filtering process.
	+ Dry/Wet Control: Internally adjusts the dry/wet ratio for each pole added.

Caveats:
* Depending on how you set it, the transparent cutting of extreme low frequencies may give rise to higher peaks.
* Use gain staging, limiting, or clipping to prevent excessive peak levels.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mastering and sound balancing applications where tonality retention is crucial while reshaping extreme lows.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Set controls around the middle of their travel for useful results. Gain stage carefully to avoid peaking issues. Consider using limiting or clipping to prevent excessive peak levels.
