CloudCoat
`Array of blur effects`
Key Controls and Settings:

* `Sustain:` Controls the amount of feedback in the effect.
    + Minimum value: 0 (no sustain)
    + Maximum value: 1 (maximum sustain)
* `Depth:` Controls the spaciousness and metallic qualities of the effect.
    + Minimum value: 0 (minimum depth)
    + Maximum value: 10 (maximum depth)

Caveats:
With sustain set to 0, CloudCoat produces a cloudy, diffuse texture. Increasing sustain creates a more roomy and spacious sound.

Best Use Cases:
For pads or ambient sounds, set Depth to 0-50% and Sustain to 0. To create a powerful room sound, feed CloudCoat into ClearCoat at the same 'select' setting.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To disrupt the signal wildly and fiercely, crank up the feedback loop. This results in a nonlinear reverb effect with broken-up feedback, creating a unique trash sound that is dynamic with your source audio.
