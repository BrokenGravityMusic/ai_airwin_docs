CloudCoat

Array of blur effects

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Sustain:` Controls the amount of feedback in the effect.
	+ Minimum value: 0 (no sustain)
	+ Maximum value: 1 (maximum sustain)
* `Depth:` Controls the spaciousness and metallic qualities of the effect.
	+ Minimum value: 0 (minimum depth)
	+ Maximum value: 10 (maximum depth)
* `Select:` Not a standard parameter, but controls how the allpasses are arranged within the effect.

Caveats:
With sustain set to 0, CloudCoat produces a cloudy, diffuse texture. Increasing sustain creates a more roomy and spacious sound.

Best Use Cases:
CloudCoat can be used on pads or ambient sounds, or to feed into ClearCoat at the same 'select' setting to create a more powerful room sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For pads or ambient sounds, set Depth to 0-50% and Sustain to 0. To disrupt the signal wildly, turn the sustain up for a highly energetic effect.
