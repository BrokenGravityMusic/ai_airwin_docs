NCSeventeen


A loudness maximizer that uses a Chebyshev filter and soft-clipper technology to produce second harmonic distortion, allowing for deep bass response despite high levels.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Adjusts the level at which NCSeventeen begins to effect the audio.
* `Filter`: A Chebyshev filter that produces second harmonic distortion, adjustable for tone.
* `Drive`: Controls the amount of soft-clipping and filtering applied to the audio.

Caveats:
* Be cautious with Threshold and Gain settings, as NCSeventeen can quickly become over-processed and "dirty".
* This plugin is not suitable for delicate or sensitive material; it's best used on loud, complex sounds like synthesizers or drum submixes.


Best Use Cases:
* Enhancing synthesizer tones: NCSeventeen can add a unique character to EDM-style synths and other digital sounds.
* Mixing heavy music: This plugin is ideal for adding deep bass response and aggressive dynamics to loud, distorted mixes.
* Creating dirty submixes: NCSeventeen can be used to add a gritty texture to drum submixes or other complex layers.


Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start with low Threshold and Gain settings, then gradually increase them as needed.
* Experiment with different Filter and Drive settings to find the right tone for your material.

Key adjustments also include:

* `Soft Clipper Level`: adjusts the amount of soft clipping applied before energy redistribution.
* `Energy Redistribution Amount`: controls the amount of energy fed back into the signal after clipping.
* `Chebyshev Filter Cut-Off`: sets the frequency below which second harmonic distortion is introduced.
* `Gain`: adjusts the overall level of the output signal.
