A plate reverb plugin resembling the sound of Plate C from Abbey Road studio, designed to evoke a shorter and brighter atmosphere.

* `Damping`: Adjusts the amount of damping, with higher numbers equaling more damping.
* `Reverb Matrix Algorithm`: Runs a completely different algorithm compared to kPlateB and other Airwindows plates.
* `Internal Delays`: Different from kPlateB, these delays contribute to the distinct character of the plugin.

kPlateC is ideal for music productions requiring a shorter and brighter plate reverb sound. It can be used in scenarios where kPlateB may not produce the desired effect, or vice versa.

Experiment with different settings to find the perfect balance between kPlateC's unique character and your specific musical needs.
