`SubsOnly`

A mix check plugin that shows only the extreme lows of a subsonic bass.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Switch`: Turn the plugin on or off.
* No controls or settings are available, as it is a control-less plugin.

Place at the end of your master buss to hear how your 2-buss chain affects the sound.

Caveats:
Avoid overloading the plugin, as it can result in a loss of groove and an excessive amount of noise. Don't switch right back to the normal sound after using SubsOnly, as it will sound incredibly dull.

Best Use Cases:
Use at the end of your master buss to hear what your 2-buss chain did to the sound. Especially useful for sanity checking when trying to achieve "commercially loud" volumes. Add depth and clarity to sub-bass elements in your mix, and tweak them against each other with SubsOnly.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Rest your ears for a moment before resuming work after using SubsOnly.
