Elation

A dynamic convolution plugin that simulates an analog effect using LA-2A convolution impulses.

	+ Range: 
	+ Type:

	+ Range: 
	+ Type: 
* Dry/Wet control: Blends the processed signal with the original input.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Elation does not properly compress audio; it affects the tonal balance instead. The plugin's behavior may be unpredictable, as described in its development notes.

Best Use Cases:
Adding a unique and interesting tone to audio signals. Creating a distinct sound that is not easily replicable with other plugins. Experimenting with unconventional effects on audio.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use the Character slider to find the perfect balance between tonal effect and bass response. The Drive slider can add a nice crunch to your sound, but be cautious not to overdo it. Adjusting the Dry/Wet control can help you achieve a desired blend of processed and original audio.
