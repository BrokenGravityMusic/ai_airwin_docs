AtmosphereChannel

A multi-stage slew clipper that creates a gluing and taming of bright digital highs, enforcing the behavior of free air and acoustic distance.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Stages: Number of stages used in the slew clipping effect (default: 14)
	+ Adjusting this control allows you to balance the amount of processing applied to your audio.
* Maximum Slew: Maximum slew value for each stage (default varies by sample)
	+ This setting determines how much the sound is "clipped" or shaped at each stage.

Caveats:

* This plugin is not calibrated to overwhelm, but rather to create a sense of space and scale in your mix.
* It's best used when working with large-scale mixes, such as rock or metal music, orchestral arrangements, or electronic mixes intended to sound loud.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating a live gig-like atmosphere for rock or metal music
* Enhancing the sense of space and distance in orchestral arrangements
* Taming bright digital highs in electronic music mixes

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with the default settings and adjust as needed to achieve your desired sound.
* Experiment with the number of stages to find the optimal balance between taming digital harshness and preserving subtler sounds.
* Adjust the maximum slew per stage to achieve the desired level of compression.
