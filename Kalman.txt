Kalman Plugin

A tool typically used in GPS satellite technology, repurposed for audio processing. It's not meant to be used as a traditional audio filter, but rather as a tool for texture shaping and transformation.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Inv:` [insert text]
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Wet:` A control for blending the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* Subtracting Kalman's output from the dry signal creates a hot, lively, aggressive texture
* Blending both elements in balance creates a wide range of tonal possibilities

Caveats:
The Kalman filter should be experienced as a crossover, not a traditional synth-style filter.

Best Use Cases:
Using the "inv" setting or subtracting its output from the dry signal can create interesting textures and effects that defy traditional frequency-based thinking.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use subtlety when blending both elements in balance to achieve nuanced sound design across a wide range of tonal possibilities.
