MatrixVerb

A wildly adjustable, strangely colorful reverb plugin with deep and flexible spaces, utilizing Householder reverb algorithms.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Damping: Adjusts the reverb decay from almost infinite to very damped.
	+ Range: 0-100
* Overall Tone Control: Handles the brightness of the reverb.
	+ Range: -10 dB to 10 dB
* Flavor Control: Affects the tonality, leaning towards platey, springy, or neutral sounds.
	+ Range: 0.0 to 1.0
* Room Size: Allows for unreasonably large spaces even at high sample rates (96k).
	+ Range: Small to enormous
* Dry/Wet Mix: Blends the wet reverb with the original dry signal.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for simulating large, cavernous spaces or plate-like reverberations in music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start by adjusting the damping and tone controls to achieve a balanced sound. Experiment with different flavor settings to find the desired tonality (platey, springy, or neutral). Use the room size control to create expansive, immersive environments. Be mindful of the dry/wet mix when blending the reverb with the original signal.
