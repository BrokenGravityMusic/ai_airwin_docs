UnBox

A distortion effect that preserves clarity by suppressing mid-range frequencies and high-passing distorted signal, eliminating aliasing.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Distortion Level:` Adjusts the overall distortion amount.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: slider
* `Mid Cutoff:` Sets the frequency below which mid-range content is suppressed.
	+ Range: 100 Hz to 10 kHz
	+ Type: slider
* `High Pass Threshold:` Determines the frequency above which the distorted signal is attenuated.
	+ Range: 5 kHz to 20 kHz
	+ Type: slider
* `Bass Presence:` Adds a hint of bass to the output for definition.
	+ Range: 0 dB to +6 dB
	+ Type: slider
* `Smoothing:` Post-processing to smooth out the distortion output and prevent aliasing.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: slider

Caveats:

* This plugin is designed to work best with natural recordings that don't contain extreme high-frequency content.
* Highpass filtering may be necessary on the distortion part to prevent aliasing.

Best Use Cases:
* Adding warmth and texture to clean, flat signals without introducing aliasing or digital artifacts.
* Enhancing definition in bass-heavy materials by adding low-end frequencies.
* Preserving high-frequency clarity while still applying some distortion to a signal.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the Distortion Level control to strike a balance between preserving high-end clarity and achieving desired mid-range warmth.
* Use the Mid Cutoff control to fine-tune the amount of original mid-range content suppressed in the distorted output.
* Experiment with different levels of Bass Presence to enhance definition without overpowering the dry signal.
