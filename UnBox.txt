UnBox

A distortion effect that selectively reduces mid-range frequencies while preserving high-end frequencies, applying a subtle texture and energy to the signal without aliasing.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Mids Cutoff:` Adjusts the frequency cutoff for the mids, allowing more or less of the original signal to pass through.
    + Range: Unknown
    + Type: Frequency cutoff
* `Distortion Level:` Sets the intensity of distortion applied to the midrange frequencies.
    + Range: Unknown
    + Type: Distortion level
* `Dry Highs:` Controls how much of the high frequencies from the original signal are allowed to pass through, unaffected by distortion.
    + Range: Unknown
    + Type: Frequency cutoff
* `Bass Presence:` Adds a hint of bass to the output for definition.
    + Range: Unknown
    + Type: Bass level
* `High Pass Threshold:` Determines the frequency above which the distorted signal is attenuated.
    + Range: Unknown
    + Type: Frequency cutoff
* `Averaging Filter Amount:` Controls the amount of high-frequency suppression in the distortion artifacts (note: not available in this version).
    + Range: Unknown
    + Type: Filter level

Best Use Cases:

* Adding warmth and texture to clean, flat signals without introducing aliasing or digital artifacts.
* Enhancing definition in bass-heavy materials by adding low-end frequencies.
* Preserving high-frequency clarity while still applying some distortion to a signal.
