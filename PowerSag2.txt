PowerSag2

Models the problem of analog power supplies that can't source enough current to drive the output of the circuit.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Depth`: Adjusts the effect range.
	+ Range: unknown
	+ Type: effect adjustment
* `Speed`: Controls the response time, creating a variety of compressive or distorative effects.
	+ Range: unknown
	+ Type: effect creation
* `Inverse/Wet control`: Adds an inverse/wet control to hear what's being taken away, allowing for more nuanced sound sculpting.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: blend control

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding character and energy to sounds without pushing them forward in the mix. Great for creating a grungey or gatey effect. Add character and grind to sounds without making them fatiguing. Balance with traditional distortion and saturation for more energy and interest in mixes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Exaggerate Depth and explore Speed to create various effects.
* Return Depth to zero and sneak small amounts of it back in to achieve the desired effect.
* Balance PowerSag2 with traditional distortion and saturation to get a lot of energy and character without making sounds too fatiguing.
