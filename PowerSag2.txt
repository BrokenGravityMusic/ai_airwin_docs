PowerSag2

Emulates power supply limitations in analog modeling by simulating the problem of an analog circuit being unable to source enough current.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Depth`: Adjusts the amount of effect applied to the sound.
	+ Range: 
* `Speed`: Controls the rate at which energy is drained from the sound, creating different types of compressive or distorting effects.
	+ Type:
* `Inverse/Wet Control`: Allows for inverse effect, where the plugin simulates the removal of energy from the sound.
	+ Blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
		- Range: 

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding grind and character to sounds without pushing them forward. Can be used to create unique distortion effects by balancing with normal overdrive.

Return Depth to zero, then sneak small amounts back in to add desired effect. Use slow Speed for a tubey effect, or quick Speed for a big-console transistor effect. Balance the inverse control to blend the taken-away sound with the original.
