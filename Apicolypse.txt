Apicolypse

A color adder plugin that works similarly to Neverland, providing a drop-in replacement for old mixes with a simpler method of generating dynamic impulses.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Hardness: A control that ranges from 0 (Density algorithm) to 1.0 (straight digital clipping). Intermediate settings create a hybrid between clean and soft-clipped sounds.
	+ Setting Hardness to 0 yields the Density algorithm.
	+ Setting Hardness to 1.0 results in straight digital clipping at the extreme.
	+ Settings between 0 and 1.0 create a hybrid effect, transitioning from clean to soft-clip at any desired point.

Caveats:
* Avoid setting Hardness to a position where soft-clipping occurs at very low levels. Instead, use settings that result in clean or highly distorted sounds.
* This plugin is best used with mixes that are heavily processed or mastered.

Best Use Cases:
Apicolypse is suitable for re-mastering old mixes or adding color to existing material that lacks depth and character.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Use Hardness at 0 (Density algorithm) for clean, un-distorted sounds.
* Set Hardness to high values (approaching 1.0) for extreme clipping effects.
* Experiment with intermediate settings of Hardness to find the desired balance between clean and soft-clipped sounds.
