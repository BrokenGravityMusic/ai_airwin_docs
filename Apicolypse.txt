Apicolypse

A drop-in replacement for old mixes, Apicolypse is a color adder that works similarly to Neverland.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Hardness:` A control that ranges from 0 (Density algorithm) to 1.0 (straight digital clipping). Intermediate settings create a hybrid between clean and soft-clipped sounds.
    + Setting Hardness to 0 yields the Density algorithm.
    + Setting Hardness to 1.0 results in straight digital clipping at the extreme.
* `Mix:` A control that determines the onset of clipping when using intermediate settings of Hardness (between 0 and 1.0).
    + Range: Soft-clipping kicks in at this level.
    + Type: The point where soft-clipping transitions into clipping.

Best Use Cases:
Apicolypse is suitable for re-mastering old mixes or adding color to existing material that lacks depth and character.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Hardness at 0 (Density algorithm) for clean, un-distorted sounds.
Set Hardness to high values (approaching 1.0) for extreme clipping effects.
Experiment with intermediate settings of Hardness to find the desired balance between clean and soft-clipped sounds.
