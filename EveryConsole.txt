	+ Algorithm selection:
		- Original Console algorithm
		- Console6
		- Console7
		- sin()/asin() routine (Console8/PurestConsoles 1-2)
		- BShifty near-sin() approximation (PurestConsole3)
		- Console Zero
* `Function application:`
	+ Channel functions
	+ Buss functions
* `Oversampling:` Enable oversampling for further processing
* `Instance Count:` Adjust the number of EveryConsole instances for complex mixing scenarios

Caveats:
None specific to EveryConsole, but may interact with other Airwindows plugins in unexpected ways.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing and mastering music where a custom console sound is desired
* Experimenting with different Console versions and modes to achieve unique sounds
* Using oversampling capabilities for additional processing

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start with a single instance of EveryConsole and adjust settings based on the desired console sound.
* Use multiple instances to create complex mixes and experiment with different Console versions and modes.
* Consider using UltrasonX or HypersonX for distributed ultrasonic filtering.
