EveryConsole

A mix-and-match plugin combining various Console algorithms, Channel functions, and Buss functions, allowing users to select different versions and applications.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Version:` Select from various Console versions (e.g., Console6, Console7, PurestConsole1-3) and modes (channel or buss)
    + Original Console algorithm
    + Console Zero
* `Channel/Buss`: Choose between using the plugin as a channel or buss function
* `Oversampling`: Use oversampling capabilities for increased resolution
* `Instance Count:` Adjust the number of EveryConsole instances for complex mixing scenarios

Caveats:
No filtering or tone shaping is applied; these must be added separately if desired.

Best Use Cases:
Combine Console versions to emulate specific classic consoles or create custom mixing scenarios.
Use as building blocks for assembling a personal Airwindows console.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Console version combinations and settings to achieve desired results.
Use oversampling for increased resolution, if available.
