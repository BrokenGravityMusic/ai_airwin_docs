Galactic2


A super-reverb plugin with a single stereo reverb matrix that uses cross-accessing delay values to create a wide soundstage.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Drive`: Adjusts the gain of new audio fed into the reverb space.
	+ Range: 0-100%
* `Sustain`: Controls the length of time the reverb decays.
	+ Range: 0-100% (feedback loops indefinitely past 2/3 up)
* `Darken`: Adjusts the tone and brightness of the reverb output.
	+ Range: 0-100% (bright to mellow and distant-sounding)
* `Wetness`: Controls the amount of reverb mixed with the original audio.
	+ Adjustment: 0-100%


Caveats:
Be cautious when cranking up Drive to avoid distortion.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating wide soundscapes and ambient textures in music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Sustain to control the length of time the reverb decays. Adjust Darken to balance tone and brightness. Set Wetness to maximum (likely full crank) for most use cases.
