Capacitor2

A plugin that adds analog modeling and mojo to the original Capacitor algorithm, modulating the cutoff frequency based on the input signal.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `NonLin`: A control that allows you to crank up the distortedness of the capacitors' behavior from very minimal to quite extreme. Sensitive to input level.
* `Boost Area:` A setting for dialing in your desired boost area.
* (matching those of Capacitor, with added NonLin control for modulating cutoff frequency)

Caveats:
None mentioned.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding intense analog coloration and emphasizing transients in sounds. Can also be used to boost narrow bandpasses for effect.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the `NonLin` control to taste to achieve desired levels of distortedness. Experiment with different `Boost Area` settings to find the optimal range for your signal. Use the (balance) control to blend the effect with the original sound.
