BuildATPDF

A dither-making toolkit that allows users to tailor the sound of noise in a way they like.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Middle sliders: Set to -1 and +1 for DoublePaul style dither.
	+ With all other sliders at 0, you have PaulDither
* Other sliders: Adjust to tailor the sound of the noise.
	+ Oscillation of surrounding sliders can create more of a DoublePaul-like effect
* Highpass control: Gentle or obvious tonal shaping; can be darkened while preserving dither functionality
* Tap settings:
	- Must be set to a combination of -1 and +1 for TPDF highpass functionality

Caveats:

* Using two identical taps (+1 and +1) will result in the same random noise
* The combination of a -1 and +1 tap is necessary for highpassed TPDF functionality

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing and mastering applications where dithering is necessary to prevent distortion
* Tailoring custom dither noises for specific audio applications
* Creating unique sound textures by adjusting tap settings

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjusting other sliders while keeping -1 and +1 taps set can help create a desired sound
* Experimenting with different slider settings and tap combinations can produce unique effects
* Oscillating sliders to create more of a DoublePaul-like effect, or adjust highpass control to suit the desired tonal characteristics.
