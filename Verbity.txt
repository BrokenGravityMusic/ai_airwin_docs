Verbity

Dual-mono reverb using feedforward topology.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Darkness`: Lowpass filter control (range: 0-1.0). Avoid setting to total darkness (1.0) to prevent DC energy trapping.
	+ Type: Lowpass filter
* `Wetness`: Non-traditional dry/wet control (range: 0-1.0). Increases Wet signal without attenuating Dry up to 0.5, then starts attenuating Dry while leaving Wet at full crank.
	+ Type: Reverb level control

Caveats:
* This is a dual-mono verb, providing no stereo gain unless actual stereo content is used as input.

Best Use Cases:
* Adding custom reverb spaces to stems and busses in Console mixes.
* Creating deep, immersive reverbs for centered signals.

Tips on Optimal Settings: 
* Adjust Darkness carefully to avoid DC energy trapping.
* Set Wetness to 0.5 or less for non-traditional dry/wet control behavior.
