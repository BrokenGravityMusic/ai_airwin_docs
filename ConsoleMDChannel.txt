Caveats:
* Designed to run at 96k or 192k sample rate, but may also work at lower rates (e.g., 44.1k) with oversampling
* May benefit from oversampling at low sample rates (2x or 4x)

Best Use Cases:
Ideal scenarios include mixing and mastering music requiring a classic MCI console tone, as well as live sound reinforcement where a high-end channel strip is needed.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use the mid stage sparingly to maintain clarity; crank up the EQ stages for tonal extremeness. Experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance of clarity and saturation.
