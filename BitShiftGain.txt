BitShiftGain

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Number of Bits to Shift`: Selects the number of bits to shift up or down, resulting in a corresponding gain or cut.
    + Range: 1-24
    + Type: Step-wise increment
* `Direction`: Determines whether to apply a boost (shift up) or pad (shift down).

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for precise gain adjustments, bit-accurate processing, dithering and gain trimming with minimal degradation.
