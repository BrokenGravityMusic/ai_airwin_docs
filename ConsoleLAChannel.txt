Key Controls and Settings:

* `Supply Voltage:` Adjusts the supply voltage to simulate the Quad Eight's unique operating range of -28 to +28 volts.
* `Filtering:` Selects from various filter types (e.g., low-pass, high-pass) with adjustable cutoff frequencies and slopes.
* `Midrange Cut:` Allows for midrange frequency reduction, with deeper cuts available as desired.
* `Gain:` Adjusts the overall gain of the channel.
