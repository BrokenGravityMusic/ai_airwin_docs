Dyno

A saturation plugin that adds intensity and fire to audio, reshaping waveforms without loudening or boosting volume.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Adjusts the character of the effect
    + `Mastered Clip Level`: Adjusts the maximum allowed peak level for the audio signal. Range: Not specified.
    + `Intersample Peak Maximum`: Sets the maximum allowable intersample peak level. Range: Not specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding subtle intensity and fire to audio, similar to Remap but with a different character.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust settings to achieve desired level of intensity and fire. To achieve a "Mastered For iTunes friendly" sound, set Mastered Clip Level to around -1.4dB and Intersample Peak Maximum to about -0.4.
Use Dyno in conjunction with other plugins for more pronounced effects.
