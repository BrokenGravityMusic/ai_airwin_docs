Dubly2

A plugin that emulates a 1960s-1970s noise reduction machine, with simple algorithms and control knobs for tweaking the sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Encode:
	+ Level: [adjusts brightness boost]
		- Range: 
	+ Frequency Control: [specifies brightness band for compression]
		- Type: slider
* Decode:
	+ Level: [adjusts phase-inverted brightness boost]
		- Range: 
	+ Frequency Control: [adds phase-inverted effect, same as Encode]
		- Type: knob
* Dry/Wet Mix: [adjusts amount of processed audio in the mix]
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* Six additional knobs for further tweaking:
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: 

Caveats:

* The highs get squished twice when using Dubly2.
* Highs are compressed twice, which can lead to weird compression time constants.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding a "gloss and sparkle" effect to audio
* Creating unusual midrange effects by tweaking Encode and Decode frequencies
* Dialing in the sound of classic records by adjusting Encode and Decode settings

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with Encode and Decode amounts to achieve desired tone quality
* Adjust Frequency Controls together or separately for unique midrange effects
* Use Dry/Wet Mix to balance processed audio with original sound
