Slew3

A plugin for analog-like darkening effects using slew clipping that reconstructs waveforms beyond sample information.

`Key Controls and Settings:`
* Filter Control: Shapes a better EQ on esses to work with Slew3.
* Brightness Adjustment: Brightens the signal before applying Slew3, allowing it to effectively reduce high-frequency peaks.
* Slew Threshold: Adjusts the limit of how much Slew3 will darken the signal.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for producing an analog top-end on digital content, particularly when dealing with high-frequency peaks and intersample distortion.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Brighten the signal before applying Slew3 to allow it to effectively reduce high-frequency peaks. Use the filter control to shape a better EQ on esses to work with Slew3.
