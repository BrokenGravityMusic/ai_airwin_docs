Slew3

A plugin for analog-like darkening effect using slew clipping that reconstructs waveforms beyond sample information.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Filter Control`: Shapes a better EQ on esses to work with Slew3.
* `Brightness Adjustment`: Brightens the signal before applying Slew3, allowing it to effectively reduce high-frequency peaks.
* `Slew Threshold`: Adjusts the limit of how much Slew3 will darken the signal.

Caveats:
Experimental plugin. May not be linear or predictable. Can be sensitive to certain types of audio.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for producing an analog top-end on digital content, particularly effective where intersample peaks occur and high-frequency peaks are a concern.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Brighten the signal before applying Slew3 to allow it to effectively reduce high-frequency peaks.
Use the filter control to shape a better EQ on esses to work with Slew3.
