NodeDither

A programmable dither plugin that uses a combination of noise samples to create various dither textures.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Sample Delay`: adjusts the delay time for the noise sample
	+ 1 sample: PaulDither (very bright one-pole highpass)
	+ 2 samples: silky texture (still very bright)
	+ 4 samples: TapeDither (nice softer noise)
	+ 8 samples: dark, flangey dither (CassetteDither or "TapeDither for 96K")
* `Reinforce Lows`: adjusts the low-frequency response of the dither
* `Flange Note`: tunes the flangey note of the dither to match your track

Best Use Cases:

Use NodeDither to create unique, moody dither noises for mixing and mastering, or experiment with comb filtering and flanging effects.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Start by experimenting with different sample delay settings to find the desired dither texture. Use the Reinforce Lows control to add depth and warmth to your dither noise. Pay attention to the flangey note of the dither and adjust it to match the tone of your track.
