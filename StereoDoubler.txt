GlitchShifter

A raw-sounding audio pitch shifter with glitch effects and a unique tone.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Note`: Pitch shift amount in semitones.
* `Trim`: Unquantized pitch shifting offset (use with caution).
* `Tightness`:
    + Turning up: Shortens buffer size, creates harsh de-rezzing bitscrunch sound or tightly tracked, robotic effects.
    + Turning down: Expands buffer size, creates smooth legato effects, but can lead to decoupling and pitch-delay artifacts.
* `Feedback`: Adds feedback to the pitch shifted signal.

Best Use Cases:
Use for creating raw, upfront pitch shifting effects or subtle, tightly tracked shifts. Ideal for adding personality to audio tracks or creating sonic mayhem.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Note and Trim controls to achieve desired pitch shifting. Balance Tightness to balance between smooth, legato effects and harsh glitch artifacts. Experiment with Feedback to create complex, layered effects.
