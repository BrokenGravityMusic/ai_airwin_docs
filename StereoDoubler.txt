GlitchShifter

Audio pitch shifter with a raw tone and glitch effects.
A unique algorithm finds seamless transitions between larger loops of sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Note`: Pitch shift amount in semitones
	+ Range: ?
	+ Type: ?
* `Trim`: Unquantized pitch shifting offset (use with caution)
	+ Range: ?
	+ Type: ?
* `Tightness`:
	+ Turning up: Shortens buffer size, creates harsh de-rezzing bitscrunch sound or tightly tracked, robotic effects
	+ Turning down: Expands buffer size, creates smooth legato effects, but can lead to decoupling and pitch-delay artifacts
	+ Range: ?
	+ Type: ?
* `Feedback`: Adds feedback to the pitch shifted signal
	+ Range: ?
	+ Type: ?

Caveats:
* Tightness control can cause the plugin to glitch out or produce uncontrolled effects.
* Decreasing Tightness too low can lead to unpredictable pitch-delay behavior.
* Be cautious when adjusting Trim setting to avoid detuned effects.

Best Use Cases:
Use for creating raw, upfront pitch shifting effects or subtle, tightly tracked shifts. Ideal for adding personality to audio tracks or creating sonic mayhem.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Note and Trim controls to achieve desired pitch shifting. Balance Tightness to balance between smooth, legato effects and harsh glitch artifacts. Experiment with Feedback to create complex, layered effects.
