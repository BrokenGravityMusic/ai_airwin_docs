Dynamics

A combination compressor-gate plugin that allows for hyper-compression and gating as a unit.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Compression`
    + Speed: controls the attack and release of the compressor (lower values = slower compression, higher values = faster compression)
    + Intensity: controls the overall compression ratio (higher values = more compression)
* `Gate`
    + Threshold: sets the level above which the gate will be triggered
    + Ratio: sets the amount of reduction when the gate is triggered
    + Release: controls how quickly the gate will re-open after closing

Best Use Cases:
* Shaping and tightening sounds for clarity and definition
* Controlling and sculpting individual tracks or stereo mixes
* Aggressive compression and gating on live recordings or heavy music genres

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different compression ratios to find the ideal balance for your audio
* Adjust the gate threshold to control how aggressively the gate engages
* Use the release control to shape the dynamic response of the plugin
