Inflamer

An Airwindowsized take on the waveshapers in Oxford Inflator.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Curve`: A control that affects the waveshaping process, with a range from 0 to 1.
	+ Control method: Select a value between 0 and 1.
	+ Note: many settings of Curve will end up being a slight volume drop when used at unity gain (Drive in the middle).
* `Drive`: A control that affects the amount of waveshaping, with a range from -30 dB to +30 dB.
	+ Control method: Adjust in 6 dB steps.
	+ Note: values are divided by powers of 2 using BitShiftGain style gain trimming.
* `Effect`: A dry/wet control that blends the two waveshapers.
	+ Control method: Adjust in a normal (non-bit shifted) range.

Caveats:

* Inflamer may produce outputs that are quieter than the real Oxford Inflator, especially when using certain settings of Curve and Drive.
* The plugin has restricted choices and options compared to the original Oxford Inflator.

Best Use Cases:

* Mastering-grade applications where a more transparent and sonorous sound is desired.
* Critical listening scenarios where radical methods are used to beat an already stellar plugin.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* When using Curve, start with values close to 0.5 and adjust in small increments to avoid volume drops.
* Use Drive values in 6 dB steps to achieve the best results.
* Pay attention to level matching when comparing Inflamer to the real Oxford Inflator.
