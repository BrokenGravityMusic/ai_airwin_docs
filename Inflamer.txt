Key Controls and Settings:

* `Drive`: Adjusts the drive level using bit shifts (very accurate divisions by powers of 2). 
    + Range: 0 to 6 dB, stepped increments.
    + Control method: Adjust in 6 dB steps.
* `Effect`: A dry/wet control that blends the two waveshapers. 
    + Range: -∞ to +∞, continuous adjustments.
* `Curve`: Adjusts the blend between two simple waveshapers, with a range from 0 to 1 and stepped increments of 0.2 (effectively 6 dB steps). Note that some settings may result in a slight volume drop when used at unity gain.
    + Control method: Select a value between 0 and 1.

Best Use Cases:

* Mastering-grade applications where a more transparent and sonorous sound is desired.
* Critical listening scenarios where radical methods are used to beat an already stellar plugin.
