`Caveats:`
* Not designed for sweeping the lowpass cutoff frequency; doing so may introduce crackles.
* Run at elevated sample rates to optimize aliasing performance and ultrasonic filtering.
`Tips on Optimal Settings:`
* To optimize aliasing performance, use Edge at elevated sample rates.
* Experiment with Lowpass and Highpass settings to find distinct tones and textures.
