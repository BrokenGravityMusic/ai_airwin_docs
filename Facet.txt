Facet
`Adds two sharp corners to the audio waveform using a modified transfer function that changes the 'knee' of the clip point.`

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Clip Point`: Adjusts the level at which the sharp corner is introduced.
    + Higher values introduce sharper corners, but still allow peaks to exceed 0 dB.
    + Lower values result in gentler corners, with the option for hard clipping near silence.
* `Corner Angle`: Changes the angle of the clip point's knee.
    + Higher values create a more pronounced 'corner' effect.
* `Knee Shape`: Alters the shape of the transfer function's knee, affecting how the clip interacts with peaks.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
    + Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:
* Adding a unique type of distortion to individual tracks or buses.
* Creating a distinct sound for specific instruments or genres.
* Enhancing the overall mix with a novel type of saturation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different Clip Point, Corner Angle, and Knee Shape settings to find the desired balance between clip and saturation.
* Pay attention to how Facet interacts with peaks and low frequencies, adjusting as needed.
* Use Facet in moderation, as its effects can be dramatic and may not always produce the intended result.
