Facet

Adds two sharp corners to the audio waveform using a modified transfer function that changes the 'knee' of the clip point.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Clip Point`: Adjusts the level at which the sharp corner is introduced.
	+ Higher values introduce sharper corners, but still allow peaks to exceed 0 dB.
	+ Lower values result in gentler corners, with the option for hard clipping near silence.
* `Corner Angle/Sharpness`: Changes the steepness of the clip point's knee and corner.
	+ Higher values create a more pronounced 'corner' effect.
* `Knee Shape`: Alters the shape of the transfer function's knee, affecting how the clip interacts with peaks.

Caveats:

* May throw an odd artifact on pure low-frequency tones at high settings.
* Can become a hard clip to silence at very low levels.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding a unique type of distortion to individual tracks or buses.
* Creating a distinct sound for specific instruments or genres.
* Enhancing the overall mix with a novel type of saturation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Clip Point and Corner Angle/Sharpness settings to find the desired balance between clip and saturation.
* Pay attention to how Facet interacts with peaks and low frequencies, adjusting Knee Shape as needed.
* Use Facet in moderation, as its effects can be dramatic and may not always produce the intended result.
