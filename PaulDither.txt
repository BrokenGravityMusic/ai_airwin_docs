PaulDither
Highpassed TPDF dither that provides mathematically correct dither without volume fluctuation.

Key Controls and Settings:
* Bit Depth: Switch between 24-bit and 16-bit operation.
* DeRez: A control to adjust the noise floor. Lower values will make the dither quieter.

Caveats:
None noted.

Best Use Cases:
Use when a highpassed TPDF dither is desired, providing a brighter tone and a quieter bed of noise. Suitable for mixing and mastering applications where detail and subtle revoicing are priorities.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust the DeRez control to suit your preferences regarding noise floor.
* Use 24-bit operation when monitoring on a DAC that takes 24-bit input, and for matching 24-bit files with what you hear.
