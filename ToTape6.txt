Due to the Flutter effect introducing varying latency, it's recommended not to use it for serious mastering purposes or in electronic genres where it may be disruptive.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding warmth and character to digital audio
* Creating a unique sound with Flutter effect

Be cautious when pushing the head bump beyond its default setting, as it can produce significant low-frequency energy.
