PhaseNudge

A phase rotator that produces a blur or smear effect on audio signals by delaying low frequencies relative to high frequencies.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Calibration`: A setting that determines the degree of delay between low and high frequencies (default value is 0.618, which corresponds to the golden ratio). Range: n/a. Type: calibration.
* `Delay Time`: A control that allows for short delays (normal for a phase rotator) to unusually long delays, making it suitable for slapback/echo effects. Range: from short (phase rotator) to long (slapback/echo effect). Type: delay time.

Caveats:
None mentioned in the provided text.

Best Use Cases:
* Diffuse pads
* Overly pointy percussive elements
* Effects loop of a lead guitar sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust calibration to 0.618 (golden ratio) for optimal results.
* Experiment with delay times to achieve desired smear or blur effect.
* Use PhaseNudge in conjunction with other plugins to enhance sound texture and depth.
