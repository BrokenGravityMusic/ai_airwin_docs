PhaseNudge

A phase rotator that produces a blur or smear effect on audio signals by delaying low frequencies relative to high frequencies.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Calibration: A setting that determines the degree of delay between low and high frequencies. Default value is 0.618, which corresponds to the golden ratio.
* Delay Time: A control that allows for short delays (normal for a phase rotator) to unusually long delays, making it suitable for slapback/echo effects.

Best Use Cases:

* Diffuse pads
* Overly pointy percussive elements
* Effects loop of a lead guitar sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust calibration to 0.618 (golden ratio) for optimal results.
Experiment with delay times to achieve desired smear or blur effect.
Use PhaseNudge in conjunction with other plugins to enhance sound texture and depth.
