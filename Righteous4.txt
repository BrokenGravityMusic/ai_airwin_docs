Righteous4's Spiral Algorithm in Overdrive

insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:

* `ADClip:` Clips peaks with precision to prevent distortion
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: Peak energy handling
* `ShortBuss:` Fills saturated signal back into mix as second harmonics, adding tone and warmth
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: Saturation and dithering
* `Spiral Algorithm (Overdrive):` Handles peak energy and dynamic range compression
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: Noise shaping and dithering

Caveats:

* Exceeding target LUFS levels can cause audible distortion, especially on bass and mix fullness.
* Clipping peaks too hard can lead to loss of headroom and distorted sound.

Best Use Cases:

* Mastering for YouTube (-13 LUFS), Apple (-17 LUFS), Tidal/Spotify (-14 LUFS)
* Pushing mixes beyond target LUFS levels requires careful adjustment

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Set target LUFS level according to service requirements
* Adjust levels carefully to avoid audible distortion
* Listen to mix in Righteous4 and adjust accordingly
* Use lower target LUFS levels for more headroom, higher for louder masters
