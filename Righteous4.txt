The Spiral algorithm is used for noise shaping and dithering.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Target LUFS:` A slider to set the target loudness level
    + Range: -30 dB to 0 dB
    + Type: Linear scale
* `ADClip:` Clipping control for peak-energy handling
    + Range: -âˆž dB to +3 dB (where +3 dB is just below clipping)
    + Type: Linear scale
* `ShortBuss:` Saturation level for the Spiral algorithm's output
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: Linear scale

Caveats:
- Pushing mixes beyond target LUFS levels can result in audible distortion.
- The key is to listen carefully and adjust levels accordingly.

Best Use Cases:
- Righteous4 is designed for final output stages where loudness needs to be optimized for various music services.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
- Set Righteous4 for specific services (e.g. Apple, YouTube) and adjust your levels accordingly.
- If you're pushing too hard and exceeding the RMS loudness targets, ADClip will clip peaks with precision, but the audible distortion from ShortBuss can still occur.
- Adjusting the target LUFS level in Righteous4 can provide more headroom for loud mixes without distortion.
