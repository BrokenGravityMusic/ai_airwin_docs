ToTape7


Emulates the sound of classic tape machines with a range of controls that allow for precise tweaking and creative experimentation.


Key Controls and Settings:


* `Highs Cutoff`: Sets the high-frequency cutoff for the tape saturation effect.
	+ Mismatches between encode and decode can create interesting effects.
* `Dubly Decode (Frequency & Amount)`: Helps smooth out compressed sounds and control the texture of your audio.
	+ Match Dubly Encode and Decode amounts for "normal" sound, mismatch them for effect.
	+ Be careful not to boost Decode Amount too much, or it will produce anti-crunch distortion.
* `Tape Drive (Boost/Pad)`: Adjusts the overall gain of the signal.
	+ 0.5 is unity gain, so you can boost or pad the signal as needed.
* `Flutter`: Emulates the "3D tape" effect, where tape bends laterally and stretches.
	+ Set to 0 if running at low sample rates or using lots of ToTape effects.
* `Bias`: Controls the biasing, which is similar to GoldenSlew but simplified for use between Dubly encode and decode.
	+ Slight overbiasing (default) is a good starting point for most sounds.
* `Head Bump (or Bass)`: Emulates the sound of tape machine head bumps.
	+ Has a built-in highpass at 0.5 setting to balance the bump against other audio.

Caveats:


* Mismatching encode and decode can create interesting effects, but be careful not to overdo it or introduce distortion.


Best Use Cases:


* Create realistic tape saturation effects
* Experiment with different combinations of controls to find unique sounds


Tips on Optimal Settings:


* Match Dubly Encode and Decode amounts for "normal" sound, mismatch them for effect.
* Be careful not to boost Decode Amount too much, or it will produce anti-crunch distortion.
* Slight overbiasing (default) is a good starting point for most sounds.
