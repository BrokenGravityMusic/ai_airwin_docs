PowerSag

Emulates power supply limitations in analog modeling, creating a compressey or distortey effect by reducing energy output.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Depth`: Control the amount of compression or distortion. Exaggerate Depth to dial in the effect.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: 
* `Speed`: Adjust the rate at which the plugin sucks energy out of the sound, affecting the type of distortion produced:
	+ Extremely slow Speed: produces a tubey effect
	+ Quick Speed: produces a big-console transistor-like effect

Caveats:
None mentioned.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding character and energy to sounds while pulling them back in the mix. Balance with normal overdrive for sculpting mixes with distortion and saturation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Return Depth to zero and add small amounts back in to achieve the desired effect.
* Experiment with Speed to create different types of distortion or compressey effects.
* Use PowerSag to add grind to sounds while pulling them back in the mix.
