PowerSag

Emulates power supply limitations in analog modeling, creating a compressey or distortey effect by reducing energy output.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Depth`: Control the amount of compression or distortion.
	+ Range: Adjusts the level of power supply limitation
	+ Type: Exaggerate Depth to create compressey or distortey effects
* `Speed`: Controls how quickly the power supply is drained.
	+ Range: Extremely slow speed creates a tubey effect, very quick speed creates a big-console transient effect
	+ Type: Adjusts the rate at which the plugin sucks energy out of the sound

Mix: Not applicable.

Best Use Cases:
Use to add character and energy to sounds without pushing them forward. Balance with normal overdrive for a more nuanced effect.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Balance the Depth control to create a desired effect, then use Speed to refine the sound. Experiment with returning Depth to zero and reintroducing small amounts for a more subtle effect.
