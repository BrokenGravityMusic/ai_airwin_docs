Mutes audio except for brief glimpses, allowing the user to play highly protected audio without engaging Content ID.

* `Mute Duration:` Adjusts the length of time that audio is muted before a brief glimpse is allowed. Values range from 0-5 seconds.
* `Glimpse Duration:` Sets the length of time for which audio is allowed to pass through during a glimpse. Less than 1 second in length.
* `Randomization:` Randomizes the timing and duration of glimpses.

Best Use Cases:

Playing brief clips of contentious or protected audio to illustrate points in educational contexts, such as metering and measurement.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different mute durations and glimpse durations to find a balance between minimizing Content ID engagement and maintaining audible glimpses. Consider using Randomization to further reduce the likelihood of triggering copyright claims.
