Overheads

A plugin for compressing only part of the sound, specifically designed to isolate cymbals from drums.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Node/Sharp: Adjusts the delay gap to control the compression effect. Larger values allow deeper sounds to be compressed, while smaller values shift the cancellation up a little.
* Compr: A compressor that drives the compression effect. Can be cranked up for more extreme effects or backed off for subtle compression.

Caveats:
High frequencies tend to slip through the cracks between the delay gap and are less affected by compression. Using Overheads on a sine wave at a precise level can unexpectedly convert it into a triangle wave.

Best Use Cases:
Mixing drum overheads to isolate cymbals from drums, creating unusual and unique soundscapes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a moderate 'Node/Sharp' setting to control the compression effect, then adjust as needed. For subtle compression effects, back off the 'Compr' control to only slightly clamp down the drums.
