ZLowpass

A lowpass filter simulator that emulates the sound of an Emu e6400 Ultra lowpass.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff Frequency:` Adjusts the frequency below which audio signals are attenuated. Range: 10 Hz to 22 kHz.
	+ Type: Frequency control
* `Resonance:` Controls the peakiness or "bite" of the lowpass filter. Range: 1% to 100%.
	+ Type: Resonance control
* `Slope:` Selects the steepness of the lowpass filter's slope. Options: 6 dB/octave, 12 dB/octave.
	+ Type: Slope selector
* `Dry/Wet Mix:` Blends the original signal with the filtered signal.

Caveats:
None reported.

Best Use Cases:

* Post-processing audio signals to remove unwanted high-frequency content.
* Simulating hardware lowpasses in digital audio workstations.
* Mixing and mastering applications where subtle lowpass effects are desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the cutoff frequency, resonance, and slope to taste for specific sound design tasks. Experiment with different settings to achieve desired tonal characteristics.
