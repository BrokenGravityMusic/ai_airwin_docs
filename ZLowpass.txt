ZLowpass

A lowpass filter simulator that emulates the sound of an Emu e6400 Ultra lowpass.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff Frequency:` Adjusts the frequency below which audio signals are attenuated. Range: 10 Hz to 22 kHz.
    + Type: Adjustable parameter
* `Resonance:` Boosts or cuts specific frequencies around the cutoff point. Range: -100 dB to +10 dB.
    + Type: Adjustable parameter
* `Slope:` Selects the steepness of the lowpass filter's slope. Options: 6 dB/octave, 12 dB/octave, 18 dB/octave, and 24 dB/octave.
    + Type: Dropdown selection

Best Use Cases:

* Post-processing audio signals to remove unwanted high-frequency content
* Simulating hardware lowpasses in digital audio workstations
* Mixing and mastering applications where subtle lowpass effects are desired

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the cutoff frequency to suit the specific musical genre or application; experiment with resonance settings to enhance or suppress specific frequencies; choose a suitable slope based on the intended use, such as a steeper slope for more aggressive filtering.
