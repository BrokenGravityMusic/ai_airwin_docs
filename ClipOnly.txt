ClipOnly

Suppresses digital clipping brightness without affecting unclipped samples.

Key Controls and Settings:

* None (no controls or adjustments needed)

Caveats:
The clip level combined with the anti-glare prevents 'digital reconstruction overs' in normal use.
This plugin does not enhance loudness beyond what it already is, unlike some other clippers.
It has a sophisticated enter/exit clip behavior that should not be considered when mixing into a safety clipper.

Best Use Cases:
General-purpose clipping and protection of audio signals from excessive peaks.
Mixing into a safety clipper (or tracking into such a mix).
Heavy load and severe clipping for effect without fussing or distraction.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
No adjustments are necessary or recommended. The plugin is designed to operate optimally with no controls or settings changes.
Focus on the sounds you're making, rather than the plugin itself.
Use the default settings for general-purpose clipping and signal protection.
Can be used with heavy load and severe clipping for effect.
