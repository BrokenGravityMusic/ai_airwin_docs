ClipOnly

Suppresses digital clipping brightness without affecting unclipped samples.

Key Controls and Settings: None.

Caveats:
The clip level combined with anti-glare prevents 'digital reconstruction overs' in normal use.
Does not enhance loudness beyond what it already is, unlike some other clippers.
Has a sophisticated enter/exit clip behavior that should not be considered when mixing into a safety clipper.

Best Use Cases:
General-purpose clipping and protection of audio signals from excessive peaks.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use the default settings for general-purpose clipping and signal protection.

This plugin can help prevent glare and harshness in audio signals, making it suitable for various use cases.
