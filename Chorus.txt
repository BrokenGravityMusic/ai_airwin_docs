Energy

A super-aggressive treble boost that accentuates attack transients and adds punchy brightness to audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Treble Boosts`: Integer multiples of the sample rate (e.g., 22K, 15K, 11K) with a fixed Q and no tunability.
* InvDryWet Control: A parameter that allows for inverted effects to be applied to the dry signal.

Best Use Cases
Adding punchy brightness and aggression to audio signals, accentuating attack transients, and creating a "brutal, raw electrifying" sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Treble Boost settings to find the desired level of brightness.
* Adjust the InvDryWet Control to isolate high-frequency content and invert it for taming nasty highs.
