ToVinyl4

A vinyl-mastering simulator that adds several vinyl-type colors to your audio, including bass reshaping, treble reduction, and groove wear.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bass Reformatter`: A multipole IIR filter that reshapes the bass, making it more mono or tightening up the center. Adjustable parameters include:
	+ Range: [adjustable]
	+ Type: [multipole IIR filter]
* `Acceleration Limiter`: A treble-reducer algorithm that zeroes in on transients and zaps them ruthlessly. Adjustable parameters include:
	+ Threshold: [adjustable]
	+ Attack/Release: [adjustable]
* `Groove Wear`: A control that simulates the effects of a stylus traveling down a vinyl groove, introducing inertia and slight distortion. Adjustable parameters include:
	+ Amount: [adjustable]

Best Use Cases:

* Reshaping bass frequencies to create a more monophonic sound or tightening up the center
* Reducing treble levels without obvious reduction or introducing distortion
* Simulating vinyl-mastering effects and creating a classic LP sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different settings for Bass Reformatter and Acceleration Limiter to achieve desired results.
* Adjust Groove Wear level carefully, as it can introduce subtle but noticeable changes to the high-end frequencies.
