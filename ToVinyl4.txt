ToVinyl4

A vinyl-mastering simulator that adds several vinyl-type colors to your audio.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bass Shape:` A special multipole IIR filter that reshapes the bass, making it more mono or tightening up the center. Adjustable parameters include:
	+ `Mono/Balance:` Adjusts the balance between the left and right channels to create a more monophonic sound.
	+ `Cutoff Frequency:` Sets the frequency below which the bass reshaping occurs.
	+ `Slope:` Controls the rate at which the low-end frequencies are attenuated or accentuated.
* `Acceleration Limiter:` A treble-reducer algorithm that zeroes in on transients and zaps them ruthlessly. Adjustable parameters include:
	+ `Threshold:` Sets the level above which the acceleration limiter kicks in.
	+ `Attack/Release:` Controls the time it takes for the limiter to respond to changes in the audio signal.
* `Groove Wear:` A control that simulates the effects of a stylus traveling down a vinyl groove, introducing inertia and slight distortion. Adjustable parameters include:
	+ `Amount:` Sets the level of Groove Wear applied to the audio signal.

Caveats:

* Not recommended for digital mastering as it's designed for vinyl emulation.
* Be cautious when using the acceleration limiter, as it can significantly alter the high-end response.
* The plugin's bass reshaping effect may increase peak energy in the low end.
* The acceleration limiter is designed for cutting heads, but can also be used for other applications.

Best Use Cases:

* Vinyl-style mastering and production
* Reshaping bass frequencies to create a more monophonic sound or tightening up the center
* Softening treble levels without obvious reduction or introducing distortion

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different settings for Bass Shape, Acceleration Limiter, and Groove Wear to achieve desired results.
* Adjust Groove Wear level carefully, as it can introduce subtle but noticeable changes to the high-end frequencies.
