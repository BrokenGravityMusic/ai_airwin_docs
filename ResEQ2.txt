ResEQ2

A single, sharp, sonorous mid peak that can be used to boost clarity and character in tracks.

* `Sweepable Mid Peak`: A resonant frequency generator with a range of frequencies to choose from.
	+ Adjusting the `Frequency` control allows you to select a specific midrange frequency to target.
	+ The `Resonance` control increases the sharpness of the peak, adding character and clarity to the track.
* `Gain`: Controls the overall level of the ResEQ2 output.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding clarity and character to tracks in post-production or mixing.
* Boosting specific midrange frequencies in instruments or vocals.
* Enhancing the overall energy of a track by targeting its presence peak.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with low gain (0.1-0.2) and gradually increase to desired level.
* Use "ow argh way too extreme" settings (e.g., 1.0) to dial in exactly what spot opens up an instrument or voice for maximum passion and sonority.
* Dial back the resonance if it becomes too sharp; start with low resonance and increase as needed.

Caveats:

* Not suitable for mixing live sound due to potential feedback issues.
* Can become "ringy" if resonance is increased too much; dial back if necessary.
