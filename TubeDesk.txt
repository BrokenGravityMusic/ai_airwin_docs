TubeDesk

A tube recording console type tone coloring plugin with a distinct flavor to how it distorts.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Tone: Adjusts the overall tone character of the plugin.
* Saturation: Controls the amount of distortion introduced by the plugin.
* Rectifier Sag: Affects how dynamics work through the plugin, imparting an obvious rectifier sag.

Caveats:
None specific to TubeDesk. As with other Desk plugins, using it on auxes and submixes can help emulate running through a lot of circuitry.

Best Use Cases:
Use on channels, auxes, or submixes where you want a distinct "analog modeling" tone. Ideal for adding a retro vibe to your recordings.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start with low settings and gradually increase to taste.
* Experiment with different combinations of Tone, Saturation, and Rectifier Sag to achieve the desired sound.
* Place TubeDesk on auxes and submixes to better emulate running through a lot of circuitry.
