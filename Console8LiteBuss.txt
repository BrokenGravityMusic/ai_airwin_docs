Console8LiteBuss

A simplified single-mix-buss plugin that brings features from the full Console8 version in a traditional Airwindows Console form.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Custom Highpass`: A custom high-pass filter algorithm that mimics real-world analog circuits.
* `Treble Softening`: A treble-softening feature to mimic the use of transformers in analog consoles.
* `ClipOnly2`: A clipping protection feature that suppresses brightness without affecting unclipped samples.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for simpler mixers where traditional Airwindows Console form is preferred. Suitable for channel, submix, or buss configurations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Set up like any pre-8 version of Console.
* Use as a replacement for Console8, but note the reduced functionality when used with full three-stage Console8 setup.
