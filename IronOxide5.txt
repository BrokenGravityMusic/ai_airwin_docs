Heavily colored Airwindows tape emulation with extensive features for intense tone shaping.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Drive: Adjusts tape saturation.
* Output Level: Sets the overall output level.
* ips Top/Bottom Cutoffs: Varies bandpass quality by adjusting top and bottom cutoff frequencies separately.
* Tape Noise: Adds anti-aliasing through a 'tape noise' factor that blurs slew.
* Inv/Dry/Wet Control: Subtracts or adds dynamic energy to specific frequency ranges, useful for cutting out fat and leaving punch.
* Flutter Range: Adjusts the range of fuzzy smear across samples produced by flutter.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for tone shaping individual tracks, such as making a snare sound more aggressive, rather than being used on the full mix.
