Caveats:
The plugin produces a fuzzy smear across one or two samples due to its non-zero latency design. This persists in all versions of IronOxide.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for tone shaping individual tracks, such as making a snare sound more aggressive, rather than being used on the full mix.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve optimal results:
* Experiment with the Inv/Dry/Wet control to cancel or accentuate specific frequency ranges.
* Adjust the Drive and Tape Noise settings to achieve desired saturation levels.
* Use the ips Top/Bottom Cutoffs to vary bandpass quality.
* Be cautious when using the plugin on the full mix, as it's designed for individual track tone shaping.
