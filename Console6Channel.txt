Console6Channel

A new and intense digital mixing console that peaks at lower dB levels. Ideal for mixing into a digital mix buss replacement without an EQ-style sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Input: The input level of the plugin.
    + Use to adjust the gain stage before hitting the Channel plugins.
* Console6Buss Plugin: A digital mix buss replacement without an EQ-style sound.
    + Use after all Channel plugins to combine the signals.

Best Use Cases:
Use one plugin per channel to apply the "inverse square" algorithm. Mix into Console6Channel like it's an analog mixing console that can be overstressed.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Gain stage before hitting the Channel plugins, and use one plugin per channel.
