ZNotch

A notch filter made to sound and act like the Emu e6400 Phaser, with constant highs, deep bass notching capabilities, overdrive, and subtle color addition to the dry signal.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Poles:` Adjusts the number of poles in the filter, affecting its cutoff frequency and resonance. (Range: 0-5)
	+ Zeroing this control will allow you to add color to the dry signal.
* `Cutoff Frequency:` Sets the frequency at which the notch is applied. Range: 20 Hz - 22 kHz.
* `Q (Resonance):` Adjusts the width of the notch. Range: 0.1-100.
* `Gain:` Controls the amount of signal that passes through the notch. Range: -24 dB to +6 dB.
* `Poles in Dry Signal:` Toggles whether the filter's poles are applied to the dry signal as well.
* `Drive:` Adds overdrive to the filtered tone, allowing for subtle character addition.

Caveats:
The plugin's behavior may vary depending on the input signal's characteristics and the desired notching effect.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding depth and character to sound designs or mixes where a notch-like filter is desired. Suitable for creating unique tonal effects by manipulating the filter's cut frequency and drive level.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different pole counts to achieve the desired coloration of the dry signal. Adjust the cut frequency and drive level to suit the specific sound design or mixing needs.
