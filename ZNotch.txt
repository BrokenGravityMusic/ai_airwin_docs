* `Poles`: Adjusts the number of poles (or zero-crossings) in the filter. Zeroing this control will allow you to add color to the dry signal.
    + Range: 0-5
* `Cut`: Sets the frequency at which the notch is applied, with deeper cuts possible into the bass range. Range: 20 Hz - 22 kHz
* `Drive`: Adds overdrive to the filtered tone, allowing for subtle character addition. Range: ?
* `Q (Resonance)`: Adjusts the width of the notch. Range: 0.1-100
* `Gain`: Controls the amount of signal that passes through the notch. Range: -24 dB to +6 dB

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding depth, character, and unique tonal effects by manipulating the filter's cut frequency and drive level. Suitable for sound designs or mixes where a notch-like filter is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different pole counts to achieve the desired coloration of the dry signal. Adjust the cut frequency and drive level to suit the specific sound design or mixing needs.
