Preponderant

A tone intensifier and balancer plugin that focuses on maximizing resonant sonority and intensity.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Resonance`: Turn up to hear what frequency ranges Preponderant is focusing on.
	+ Type: Gain control
* `Wet`: Adjust the balance between the processed sound and the original sound.
	+ Type: Blend control
* `Narrow`, `Medium`, `Wide`:
	+ Use these controls to select frequency bands (each band is twice as wide as the previous one).
	+ Set them to areas in your sound, such as midrange or specific frequencies.
	+ Range: None specified, but each band is twice as wide as the previous
* `Dry/Wet`: Blend Preponderant output with original audio.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Do not use Preponderant on room mics or overall mics. It may be suitable for spot mics, toms, kick, heavy guitar stems, and similar applications where retention of dynamics is desired.

Best Use Cases:
Spot mics, toms, kick drums, heavy guitar stems

Tips on Optimal Settings:
1. Set Narrow, Medium, and Wide controls to specific frequency ranges (midrange).
2. Turn up Resonance and Wet to hear focused energy.
3. Adjust Preponderant's balance based on selected bands' activity.
4. Start with minimal Preponderant input; gradually increase for desired effect.
