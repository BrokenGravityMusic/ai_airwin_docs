Pockey2

A plugin that generates lo-fi hiphop sounds using integer bitcrushing and frequency crushing, offering efficient CPU usage.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `BitDepth`: Adjusts the bit depth from 4 to 16 bits.
	+ Range: 4-16
	+ Type: Integer
* `DeFreq`: Adjusts the frequency crushing level (steepy adjustment at lower sample rates).
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: Steppy adjustment
* `Rez`: Controls the level of bitcrushing, with higher values resulting in more extreme effects.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type: Integer
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original (not explicitly mentioned, but implied as part of the plugin's functionality)
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `StairstepCount`: Sets the number of stairsteps for bitcrushing (5037 or 5038).
	+ Range: 5037-5038
	+ Type: Integer

Caveats:
Running 16-bit depth may not produce significant differences due to the use of uLaw encoding.
Frequency crushing at high settings may exhibit 'stairstep' behavior at lower sample rates (44.1k).

Best Use Cases:
Adding lo-fi hiphop texture to DAW tracks
Transforming sounds into retro digital or classic lo-fi hip hop samples

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with DeFreq and StairstepCount for unique tone and texture.
Adjust BitDepth and Rez to balance sound quality and CPU usage.
