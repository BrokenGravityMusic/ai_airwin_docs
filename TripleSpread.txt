TripleSpread

A stereo tripler with extra wideness and GlitchShifter processing, capable of doubling or tripling a track while maintaining stereo width.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet`: Blends the original signal with the widened effect.
    + Increase to introduce the effect and overpower 'dry' (mono signal).
    + Fades out mid content of added stereo stuff for hyper-wide effect.
* `Tightness Control`: Adjusts pitch shifting and widening.
    + Increase to glitch or revert to dry, or turn down for unpredictable echoey effect.
    + Tighten up for controlled vagueness or tie to rhythmic elements.

Best Use Cases:

* Widening LCR guitars while keeping the 'guitar orchestra' effect relatively tight.
* Adding an unpredictable echoey effect on ambient pads, wide stereo synthetic things, etc.
* Doubling each instrument in a stereo mix and maintaining stereo separation.
* Creating a big wide stereo effect on an LR pair of instruments.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with Dry/Wet ratio to achieve desired level of widening and blending with original signal.
* Adjust Tightness Control to control pitch shifting and vagueness in widened voices.
* Use Tightness control to tie the effect to a specific rhythmic element.
