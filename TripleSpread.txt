TripleSpread

A stereo tripler with extra wideness and GlitchShifter processing, designed to create a hyper-wide effect by fading out mid content as dry/wet is brought up.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet`: Adjusts the balance between original signal and widened sound.
	+ As Dry/Wet increases, mid content of added stereo sound fades out, creating a hyper-wide effect.
* `Tightness` (from GlitchShifter):
	+ Increase to glitch or revert to dry.
	+ Decrease for an unpredictable echoey effect with pitch-shifted tripled voices.

Caveats:
None noted.

Best Use Cases:

* Widening LCR guitars while keeping the 'guitar orchestra' effect relatively tight.
* Creating a wide stereo effect on a LR pair of instruments.
* Making a big wide stereo effect on an LCR submix, sounding like about twelve instruments.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Dry/Wet to balance between original signal and widened sound. Experiment with Tightness control for unpredictable effects or rhythmic tying.
