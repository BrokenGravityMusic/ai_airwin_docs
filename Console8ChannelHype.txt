Console8ChannelHype

Adds analog simulation to the original 8-channel console input, moving it to a channel/submix/buss topology.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Mode:` Changes the topology of the plugin from input to channel/submix/buss.
* `Analog Simulation:` Activates or deactivates the analog circuit simulation.
* `Gain:` Adjusts the overall gain level of the simulated analog circuit.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for applications where a brighter, sparklier sound is desired. Can be used to enhance the tone and character of individual channels or submixes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the gain to match the desired level of analog simulation. Experiment with different settings to achieve the optimal balance between brightness and sparkle.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Topology`: Switch between Console8ChannelHype (default) and Channel/Submix/Buss modes.
* `Analog Simulation`: Toggle on/off for simulated warmth and character.
* `Gain`: Adjust the overall gain level of the plugin.
* `Trim`: Fine-tune individual channel gains.

Caveats:
* Analog simulation may introduce noise or artifacts in certain situations.
* Topology changes may affect overall signal flow and headroom.
