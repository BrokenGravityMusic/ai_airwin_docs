Console8ChannelIn

A plugin that upgrades the original Console8ChannelHype to a channel/submix/buss topology with analog simulation.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Topology:` Switch between Console8ChannelHype (default) and Channel/Submix/Buss modes.
	+ Type: Dropdown menu
* `Analog Simulation:` Toggle on/off for simulated warmth and character.
	+ Range: On/Off

	+ Type: Fader or slider

Caveats:
Analog simulation may introduce noise or artifacts in certain situations. Topology changes may affect overall signal flow and headroom.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing and mastering applications where a brighter, sparklier sound is desired.
* Upgrading Console8ChannelHype for improved channel/submix/buss functionality.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust gain and trim settings to match the original Console8ChannelHype signal flow. Analog simulation should be used judiciously to avoid over-processing or introducing unwanted artifacts.
