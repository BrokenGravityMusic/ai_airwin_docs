Caveats:
AU-only plugin, may not work reliably with different programs.
Latency declaration can cause added latency and calibration issues.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing and fine-tuning delays for specific instruments or sounds.
* Creating complex delay effects by combining millisecond, sample, and subsample delays.
* Experimenting with negative delay for unique sound design possibilities.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use the regular SampleDelay plugin if you need to track into a mixing system.
