SampleUndelay

A plugin featuring millisecond, sample, and subsample delays, with the addition of negative delay capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Millisecond Delay: 0-100 ms control
	+ Range: up to 100 ms
	+ Type: time adjustment
* Sample Delay: 0-10 samples control
	+ Range: 0-10 samples
	+ Type: sample-based delay
* Subsample Trim: 0-1 sample control
	+ Range: 0-1 sample
	+ Type: subsample timing trim
* Inverse/Dry/Wet Control: Affects how much of the delayed signal is mixed with the original
	+ Range: variable mix levels

Caveats:

* This plugin does not support tracking into the mixing system due to latency issues.
* It may experience incompatibilities with certain programs, especially at high sample rates.

Best Use Cases:
Use as a substitute for SampleDelay when negative delay is required. For VST users, consider using regular SampleDelay or sliding tracks earlier in the DAW instead.
