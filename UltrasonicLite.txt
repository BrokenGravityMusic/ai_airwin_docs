A one-stage filter simulator designed for use in digital mixes, enhancing high-frequency detail and control in audio signals.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Type:` Select from various filter types (e.g. low-pass, high-pass)
	+ Adjusts the cutoff frequency of the filter
* `Frequency`: Adjusts the frequency range of the filter (e.g., 10 kHz to 20 kHz)
	+ Sets the overall gain level of the filter's output
	+ Selects the steepness of the filter's slope (e.g., -6 dB/octave, -12 dB/octave)
* `Resonance`: Adjust the resonance of the filter


Caveats:
May introduce artifacts in certain audio signals. Best used in conjunction with other effects or processing stages to maintain a balanced sound.


Best Use Cases:
Use as a tone-shaping tool for individual tracks or buses. Experiment with different filter types and settings to create unique sounds. Enhancing high-frequency detail and clarity in digital mixes, adding depth and presence to vocals and instruments.


Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start by adjusting the Frequency control to target specific frequency ranges (e.g., 15 kHz, 20 kHz). Adjust Gain and Slope controls to balance the filter's output with the original signal. Start with moderate Q factor values (around 5-10) and adjust to taste.
