A smoothed biquad filter with adjustable resonance control, capable of producing a wide range of tonal variations from soft and smooth to nasty and edgy.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `ResEdge`: A smoothing control that can be lowered to 0 for a softer tone or turned up for more edge. Defaults to 0.1.
* `Frequency`: Sets the filter frequency, ranging from "zero" to "one", acting like DC to Nyquist at any sample rate.
* `Filter Type`: Selects one of four common biquad options:
    + Lowpass
    + Highpass
    + Bandpass
    + Notch
* `Resonance`: A control that can be used to dial in an extreme low or high cut, as well as adjust the sharpness or dullness of the filter edge.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original

Best Use Cases:
Use YNotch as a tone shaper or filter in music production, especially when seeking unique and extreme tonal variations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve a smooth and organic sound, lower the ResEdge control to 0. To create an extreme edge, increase the ResEdge control and adjust the resonance accordingly. Experiment with different filter types and frequency settings to find unique tones.
