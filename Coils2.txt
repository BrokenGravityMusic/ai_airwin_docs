Coils2

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Saturation:` Determines what happens outside the 'resonant band'. It clamps down, not boosting into maximum overload. Turning it up all the way creates a bandpass effect.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: controls amount of overload and distortion
* `Cheapness:` Narrows the band in which the transformer's putting out clean, pure sound. Increasing Cheapness distorts and loses lows and highs, and introduces a hysteresis effect of magnetizing the transformer core.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: controls frequency range where transformer produces clean sound
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:
* Shaping and sculpting existing audio, such as on a 2-buss to tighten lows and give more impact and vibe.
* Combining with other plugins for unique sounds.
