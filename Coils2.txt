Coils2
A transformer overdrive emulator that shapes the way a transformer produces sonority.

`Key Controls and Settings:`
* `Saturation:` Determines what happens outside the 'resonant band'. It clamps down, not boosting into maximum overload. Turning it up all the way creates a bandpass effect.
* `Cheapness:` Narrows the band in which the transformer's putting out clean, pure sound. Increasing Cheapness distorts and loses lows and highs, and introduces a hysteresis effect of magnetizing the transformer core.

`Caveats:`
* Do not use too much saturation and cheapness for full mixes.
* Turning everything up all the way is not recommended.

`Best Use Cases:`
* Shaping and sculpting existing audio, such as on a 2-buss to tighten lows and give more impact and vibe.
* Combining with tube distortion effects to get an 'amp-like' character.

* Subtle use on individual tracks or buses to add warmth and character.
* Combining with tube distortion effects for an "amp-like" tone.
* Tightening lows and adding impact to a 2-buss mix.

`Tips on Optimal Settings:`
* Play with the knobs to find the desired effect.
* Use Saturation to control overload, not gain.
* Adjust Cheapness to balance distortion and sonority.
* Combine Coils2 with other plugins for unique sounds.
* Experiment with the knobs to find the desired balance between Saturation and Cheapness.
* Use subtle settings to maintain accuracy, rather than treating Coils2 as a stompbox effect.
* Remember to not overdo it on full mixes!
