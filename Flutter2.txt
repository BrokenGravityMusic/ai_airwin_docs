Flutter2


A standalone tape flutter effect with adjustable speed and amount of flutter.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Speed`: Adjusts the rate at which the flutters occur, ranging from slow to fast.
* `Amount`: Controls the intensity of the flutter effect.
* `Dry/Wet`: Blends the original signal with the flattered signal.

Caveats:
Cranking up the speed and amount can lead to a heavy guitar doubler sound. At high settings, Flutter2 may occasionally go mono.


Best Use Cases:

* Enhancing tape-like qualities in audio recordings.
* Creating a cassette or reel-to-reel tape sound.
* Mimicking the sound of a VHS or Space Echo device.
* Thickenning double-tracked guitar sounds with an additional "thickener" track and Flutter2.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For a heavy guitar doubler sound, crank up the speed to a slow value. Use multiple tracks with Flutter2 for thicker, wider sounds: one track for the original signal, another for doubling, and a third for using Flutter2 as a "thickener" in the center.
