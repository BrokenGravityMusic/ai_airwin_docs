Flutter2

A standalone tape flutter effect plugin with adjustable speed and intensity.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Speed`: Adjusts the frequency of the flutter effect.
	+ Range: slow to fast
* `Intensity`: Controls the overall level of the flutter effect.
* `Dry/Wet Control`: Blends the dry (original) signal with the flattered signal.
* `Flutter Speed`: Slows or speeds up the flutter effect.

Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original 
Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
* Cranking up the speed and intensity can lead to a heavy guitar doubler sound.
* At high settings, Flutter2 may occasionally go mono.

Best Use Cases:
* Emulating reel-to-reel, cassette, and VHS tape effects
* Creating fake hard-panned doubled guitar sounds
* Enhancing stereo spatiality in audio mixes

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* For a heavy guitar doubler sound, crank up the speed to a slow value.
* Use multiple tracks with Flutter2 for thicker, wider sounds: one track for the original signal, another for doubling, and a third for using Flutter2 as a "thickener" in the center.
