CrickBass

Flexible but aggressive bass tone simulator that combines dual pickups characteristics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Drive`: Adjusts the gain level for both BigAmp (neck pickup) and LilAmp (bridge pickup) simulations.
	+ Recommended to balance gain levels between neck and bridge pickups.
* `Tone`: Adjusts the midrange articulation and tone quality of both simulations.
	+ Recommended to match with snare drum percussive noises.

Caveats:
* Not designed for full-range sound, but rather to mimic a cab sim's EQ filtering.
* Avoid setting drive levels too high to prevent excessive brightness and "supertweeter" effects.
* Best results achieved by balancing drive levels between neck and bridge pickups.

Best Use Cases:

* Dual pickup bass DI tracking
* Stereo bass tracking with neck and bridge pickups on separate outputs

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Balance drive levels between neck and bridge pickups to achieve desired tone balance.
* Adjust tone controls to match snare drum percussive noises and avoid excessive brightness.
* This plugin is designed for dual pickups (neck and bridge), but can also be used with a mono bass input.
