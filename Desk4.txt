Desk4

Analog coloration plugin with distinctive tone shaping capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Drive Control:` A boost control for adding saturation and dirt to the sound.
	+ Adjusts level of drive.
* `Treble Choke:` Brightness conditioner control.
	+ Use subtly to avoid generating artifacts (DC) at extreme settings.
* `Power Sag Control:` Power supply overload simulation control.
	+ Crank up for tube power supply sag behaviors.
* `Frequency Control:` Control for moving the area of interest down, affecting power supply sag behaviors.
	+ Adjusting this control moves the effect to higher frequencies.

Caveats:
Be cautious when using the Treble Choke or Power Sag controls to avoid generating artifacts (DC). Use subtle adjustments on these controls and be careful with extreme settings.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding depth and richness to instruments
* Enhancing the tone of vocal tracks
* Creating unique textures and atmospheres

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Drive control sparingly to maintain natural-sounding distortion. Apply Treble Choke in small increments to add brightness without introducing artifacts. Experiment with Power Sag and Frequency controls to create unique power supply sag behaviors.
