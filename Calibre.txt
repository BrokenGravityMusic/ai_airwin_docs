	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Creates a low-pass filter effect

Caveats:

* High character settings can cancel out bass frequencies.
* Phase inversion may introduce unusual coloration when combined with other effects.

Best Use Cases:
Enhancing the tone of individual tracks, creating unusual low-pass filters by duplicating and phase-flipping the track.

Tips on Optimal Settings: Experiment with moderate character settings (around 50-70%) to find a balance between tone shaping and bass preservation.
