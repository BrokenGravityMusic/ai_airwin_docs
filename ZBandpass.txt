ZBandpass

A bandpass filter emulating the Emu e6400 Ultra bandpass, ideal for creating filtered sounds with a wide frequency range.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Poles`: Adjusts output gain and allows for more headroom.
	+ Lower values allow for more distorted sounds, while higher values provide cleaner results.
* `Gain`: Sets the overall level of the filtered signal.
* `Cutoff Frequency`: Sets the center frequency of the bandpass, which determines the range of frequencies passing through the filter.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Use ZBandpass to create filtered sounds with a wide frequency range. It's ideal for situations where you need to isolate and enhance specific frequencies within an audio signal.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start by adjusting the Poles control to your desired level of distortion.
* Balance the output gain using the Gain control to achieve the best possible results.
* Experiment with different settings, including adjusting the Cutoff Frequency, to find the perfect balance between frequency isolation and overall sound quality.
