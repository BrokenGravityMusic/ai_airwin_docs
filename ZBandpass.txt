ZBandpass

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Poles`: Adjusts output gain and allows for more headroom. Lower values allow for more distorted sounds, while higher values provide cleaner results.
    + Range: 
    + Type: Control
* `Gain`: Sets the overall level of the filtered signal.
    + Range: 
    + Type: Control
* `Cutoff Frequency`: Sets the center frequency of the bandpass, which determines the range of frequencies passing through the filter.
    + Range: 
    + Type: Control

Best Use Cases:
Use ZBandpass to create filtered sounds with a wide frequency range. It's ideal for situations where you need to isolate and enhance specific frequencies within an audio signal.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with different Poles settings to achieve desired filter responses.
* Adjust the Cutoff Frequency to target specific frequencies or create subtle tone variations.
* Use the left half of the Poles control to increase output gain and balance distorted signals with dry audio.
