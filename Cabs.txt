* `Output` and `Dry/Wet`: Controls output level and blend of wet and dry signals.

Best Use Cases:


Ideal for high-gain distortion, use with guitars or other instruments where extreme tonal shaping is desired. Also suitable for adding texture to low-passed signals.


Tips on Optimal Settings:


Experiment with gain and filtering controls to achieve unique tone combinations. Adjusting the lowpass cutoff can produce interesting tonal effects when used in conjunction with high-gain clipping. Use the highpass control to enhance texture and add definition to low-passed signals.
