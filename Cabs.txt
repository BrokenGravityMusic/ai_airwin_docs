Cabs

A guitar speaker cabinet simulator with adjustable cab size and room loudness emulation.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cab Size`: Adjusts the presentation of the simulated cabinet tone.
	+ Range: variable
	+ Type: controls the tone and presentation
* `Room Loud`: Emulates the loudness of the speaker in a real-world setting, up to a point where settings beyond 0.6 are not considered real-world.
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Type: emulates room loudness
* `Tone Intensity`: Controls the character and intensity of the cab tone, related to cab size and potentially becoming weird at high settings (beyond 0.6 or 0.7).
	+ Range: variable
	+ Type: controls tone character and intensity

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for tracking guitars, as a preamp simulator or to enhance the tone of recorded guitars. Also suitable for simulating various amp setups in ITB processing.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with reasonable settings (e.g., Room Loud around 0.6) and adjust to taste. Consider using Cabs in combination with other Airwindows plugins to achieve unique tones that don't exist in the real world.
