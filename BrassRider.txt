Caveats:
* Not suitable for general drum mixing or users unfamiliar with metal mix techniques.
* May not work as intended in mixes that don't feature heavy, brutal sounds.

Best Use Cases:
* Heavy metal drum mixing where intense cymbal crashes are desired.
* When sculpted spot-mic sounds are already present on drums and toms.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust the threshold control to engage BrassRider's boosting behavior during intense crash cymbal hits.
* Bury the overhead mics in the mix, then use BrassRider to selectively boost them during these moments.
