Channel9

A plugin that combines the features of Channel8 with ultrasonic filtering and new tone-shaping settings, allowing for more flexible mix sculpting.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Ultrasonic Filtering`: Controls the steepness of the filter, with options for Neve, SSL, API, Teac, and Mackie console models
	+ Adjusts the cutoff point of the filter to simulate the characteristics of each console model
* `Teac` and `Mackie` settings: Two new tone shaping algorithms inspired by classic consoles
	+ Reshape sound in a way that's suitable for house/techno music
	+ Control bright highs and deep bass frequencies
* `Two-stage Drive Control`: Adjusts the overall distortion and warmth of the sound
* `Highpass`: A newly improved high-pass filter for controlling low-end frequencies
* `Slew clipping`: A type of clipping that adds character to the sound

Caveats:
None mentioned.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing Console-style mixes: use Channel9 after ConsoleBuss
* General mixing: use as a subtle distortion/fattener with tone-shaping capabilities
* Adding subtle distortion and fattening to a mix
* Shaping tone in a classic way, while minimizing interference with the original sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the ultrasonic filtering cutoff point to taste, depending on your mix and desired sound.
* Experiment with different drive levels and high-pass settings to find the perfect balance for your mix.
* For a more aggressive sound, adjust the ultrasonic filtering control towards steeper cutoffs (Neve or API).
* To achieve a brighter sound, use the Mackie setting.
* Use in conjunction with other Airwindows plugins for added depth and character.
