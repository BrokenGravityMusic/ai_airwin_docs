Channel9

A channel strip emulator with ultrasonic filtering and two new tone-shaping settings inspired by Teac and Mackie consoles.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Ultrasonic Filtering`: 
	+ Controls the steepness of the filter, with options for Neve, SSL, API, Teac, and Mackie console models.
	+ Adjusts the cutoff point of the filter to simulate the characteristics of each console model.
* `Teac` and `Mackie` settings: 
	+ Reshape sound in a way that's suitable for house/techno music.
	+ Control bright highs and deep bass frequencies.
* `Two-stage Drive Control`: 
	+ Adjusts the overall distortion and warmth of the sound
* `Highpass`: 
	+ A newly improved high-pass filter for controlling low-end frequencies
* `Slew Clipping`: 
	+ Adds character to the sound

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing Console-style mixes: use Channel9 after ConsoleBuss
* General mixing: use as a subtle distortion/fattener with tone-shaping capabilities

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the ultrasonic aliasing-filtering feature to taste, depending on your mix and desired sound.
* Experiment with different drive levels and high-pass settings to find the perfect balance for your mix.
* For a more aggressive sound, adjust the ultrasonic filtering control towards steeper cutoffs (Neve or API).
* To achieve a brighter sound, use the Mackie setting.
