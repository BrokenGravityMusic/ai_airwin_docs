Infinity2

Sustains and layers sounds forever with an infinite reverberation effect, tone shaping, and a kill-switch.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Feedback:` Control the level of feedback in the reverb path.
* `Damping:` Adjust the brightness and treble response of the reverb (0 = full brightness, 1 = significant treble fall-off). Setting to 0.125 or lower will replicate the original Damping effect.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Allpass Bypass:` Disable the allpasses at the beginning for brighter, more transient-rich input sounds.
* `Verb Size:` Adjust the maximum reverb size (tied to sample rate).
* `Pitch Crank:` Increase the pitch of the reverb for unusual effects.

Caveats:
Damping control can interact with frequencies and cause feedback reinforcement. Monitor levels when using this feature.

Best Use Cases:
Use Infinity2 to create ambient spaces, pads, and textures that sustain indefinitely. Ideal for experimental and ambient music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust the Damping control to taste, but be aware of its potential effects on frequencies.
* Use the Feedback control to shape the reverb response.
* Experiment with the Verb Size and Pitch Crank controls to create unique textures and effects.
* Disable allpasses for brighter input sounds.
