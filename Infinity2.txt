Infinity2

Sustains and layers sounds forever with an infinite reverberation effect, allowing tone shaping and a kill-switch.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Feedback`: Control the level of feedback in the reverb path.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Damping`: Adjust the brightness and treble response of the reverb. (0 = full brightness, 1 = significant treble fall-off)
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Note: Setting to 0.125 or lower will replicate the original Damping effect.
* `Allpass Bypass`: Disable the allpasses at the beginning for brighter, more transient-rich input sounds.
	+ Type: Toggle switch
* `Verb Size`: Adjust the maximum reverb size (tied to sample rate).
	+ Range: [insert text]
* `Pitch Crank`: Increase the pitch of the reverb for unusual effects.
	+ Range: [insert text]

Best Use Cases:
Use Infinity2 to create ambient spaces, pads, and textures that sustain indefinitely. Ideal for experimental and ambient music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Damping control to taste, but be aware of its potential effects on frequencies. Use the Feedback control to shape the reverb response. Experiment with the Verb Size and Pitch Crank controls to create unique textures and effects. Disable allpasses for brighter input sounds.
