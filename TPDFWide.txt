TPDFWide

A high-quality Triangular Probability Density Function (TPDF) dither plugin with 16/24-bit output that reduces quantization distortion and allows for deeper noise floor exploration. Designed to sound better and wider than generic TPDF dithers.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `DeRez`: Control to adjust the bit depth of the dither, ranging from low-bit realms (with a 'regulation' TPDF dither) to normal operation (24 or 16 bit modes)
	+ Range: Low-bit realms to 24/16 bit
	+ Type: Adjustment control
* `Bit Depth`: Output bit depth selection, with options for 16/24-bit
	+ Range: 16/24-bit
	+ Type: Selection menu
* Channel Check: The plugin checks if the two stereo channels have the same random values. If they are, it rerolls one channel to maintain randomness and prevent mono dither.

Caveats:
Using low DeRez values can introduce DC offset; high DeRez values may affect soundstage and wideness.

Best Use Cases:
Suitable for use as a 24-bit dither for monitoring and file-making. Ideal for export to 16-bit formats when using DeRez set to 0 (normal operation).

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Set DeRez control to 0 for normal operation in 24 or 16 bit modes. Use DeRez control to adjust the bit depth of the dither for low-bit realms and optimal noise floor representation.
