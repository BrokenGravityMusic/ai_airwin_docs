TPDFWide

A high-quality Triangular Probability Density Function (TPDF) dither plugin with 16/24-bit output. Designed to reduce quantization distortion and allow for deeper noise floor exploration.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `DeRez:` A setting that allows you to adjust the bit depth of the dither, ranging from low-bit realms (with a 'regulation' TPDF dither) to normal operation (24 or 16 bit modes)
	+ Range: Low-bit to 0
	+ Type: Bit depth control
* `Bit Mode:` Output bit depth selection, with options for 16/24-bit
	+ Range: 16-bit to 24-bit
	+ Type: Output format
* `Channel Check:` The plugin checks if the two stereo channels have the same random values. If they are, it rerolls one channel to maintain randomness and prevent mono dither.
	+ Range: Off/On
	+ Type: Randomization control

Caveats:
Using low DeRez values can introduce DC offset. High DeRez values may affect soundstage and wideness.

Best Use Cases:
Suitable for use as a 24-bit dither for monitoring and file-making. Ideal for export to 16-bit formats when using DeRez set to 0 (normal operation).

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Set DeRez control to 0 for normal operation in 24 or 16 bit modes. Use DeRez control to adjust the bit depth of the dither for low-bit realms and optimal noise floor representation.
