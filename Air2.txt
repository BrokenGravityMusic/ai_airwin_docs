Air2

A treble-boost plugin with three bands (Hiss, Glitter, and Air), a Silk control for softening highs, and an innovative Dry/Wet control.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Three treble-boost bands: Hiss, Glitter, and Air. Each band has its own frequency response and characteristics.
* Silk control: applies a transformer-biased second harmonic creation to the highs, providing a soft and pretty tone.
* Dry/Wet control:
	+ Up to 0.75: Full volume dry signal
	+ Between 0.75 and 1 (full Wet): Gradual fade of the original dry signal, resulting in full-wet mode that only outputs the brightener bands.

Caveats:
None mentioned.

Best Use Cases:
Treble-boosting specific frequencies in music productions.
Adding brightness and airiness to tracks.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with each band's frequency response to find the desired tone.
Adjust the Silk control to taste, but be aware that pushing it too far can create an overly harsh sound.
Use the Dry/Wet control to balance the brightener bands with the dry signal, and crank it up for extreme treble-boosting effects.
