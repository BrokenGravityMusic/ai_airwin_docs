Air2

A treble-boost plugin with three bands: Hiss, Glitter, and Air, which provide a different bright EQ sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Hiss`: Treble-boost band 1
* `Glitter`: Treble-boost band 2 (similar to Energy2's 'Rat' band)
* `Air`: Treble-boost band 3 (broader, softer air band)
* `Dry/Wet`: Control for balancing the Energy style of increasing the effect with traditional Dry/Wet control
	+ Up to 0.75: Full volume dry signal
	+ Between 0.75 and 1: Dry signal fades away as wet signal increases

Best Use Cases:

* Treble-boosting specific frequencies in music productions.
* Adding brightness and airiness to tracks.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different combinations of Hiss, Glitter, and Air bands for a unique sound.
* Adjust the Dry/Wet control to balance the brightener bands with the dry signal, and crank it up for extreme treble-boosting effects.
