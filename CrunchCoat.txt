CrunchCoat

A digital reverb that takes the ClearCoat bright ambience reverb into unknown territory by undersampling it to as low as 40 Hz, creating a "cursed retro digital" sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Undersample Rate`: Adjusts the sample rate from 40 Hz to original sample rate.
	+ Range: 40 Hz - Original Sample Rate
	+ Type: Integer value
* `Interpolation Mode`: Sets the interpolation method for the waveform (straight lines between points).
	+ Range: 1-5
	+ Type: Select box
* `Input Filtering`: Enables or disables input filtering (primitive).
	+ Type: On/Off switch
* `Pitch-Swoop`: Controls the pitch-swooping of the reverb.
	+ Range: -100% to 100%
	+ Type: Sliding scale
* `Regeneration`: Adjusts the regeneration level from infinite sustain to complete cutoff.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Sliding scale

Caveats:

Undersampling may introduce "square-wavey" or pointy waveform distortion. Input filtering is primitive, adding color and texture but potentially producing soft waves or spikes.

Best Use Cases:

Use on specific sounds where a unique, aggressive reverb tone is desired. Ideal for creating distinctive ambiance in mixes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different undersample rates and interpolation modes to achieve desired results.
* Be cautious when adjusting the input filtering, as it may affect the overall sound quality.
* Use pitch-swoop and regeneration controls to add depth and interest to your sounds.
* Consider using sparingly to avoid cluttering the mix with excess energy.
