CrunchCoat


A digital reverb that takes the ClearCoat bright ambience reverb into unknown territory by undersampling it to as low as 40 Hz, creating a "cursed retro digital" sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Undersample Rate`: Reduces sample rate from original to approximately 40 Hz.
	+ Range: Adjustable
	+ Type: Undersampling
* `Interpolation Method`: Sets the interpolation method for the waveform (straight lines between points).
	+ Range: Selectable options
	+ Type: Interpolation mode

Caveats:
Undersampling may introduce "square-wavey" or pointy waveform distortion. Input filtering is primitive, adding color and texture but potentially producing soft waves or spikes.

Best Use Cases:
Use on specific sounds where a unique, aggressive reverb tone is desired. Ideal for creating distinctive ambiance in mixes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Experiment with the undersample rate to find the desired level of distortion.
* Adjust the interpolation method to achieve the desired waveform shape.
* Use sparingly to avoid cluttering the mix with excess energy.
