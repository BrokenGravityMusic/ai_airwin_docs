Smooth

A multi-purpose plugin that can tame pointy sounds or make drums explode. It's a clipper that can be used to soften spikes in audio signals, similar to ToVinyl or Acceleration, but with more of a clipping effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Amount`: Adjusts the amount of smoothing applied.
	+ Range: 0-100%
	+ Type: Adjustment
* `Output Level`: Sets the output level of the smoothed signal.
	+ Range: -24.8 dB to +6.0 dB
	+ Type: Adjustment
* `Dry/Wet`: Mixes the original and smoothed signals.
	+ Range: 0-100%
	+ Type: Adjustment
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
None mentioned in the text.

Best Use Cases:

* Softening spikes in audio signals, such as spikey acoustic guitars or overly edgy mics.
* Cranking up large amounts of smoothing on drums to produce a huge explosive effect.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* For subtle use, adjust the Amount control carefully to just snip off stray edges without affecting tone.
* When used aggressively, pull back the Smooth plugin until it sounds like it's not doing anything, and then gradually increase the amount to achieve the desired effect.
