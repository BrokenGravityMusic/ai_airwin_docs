Smooth

A multi-purpose plugin that can tame pointy sounds or make drums explode. It's a clipper that can be used to soften spikes in audio signals, similar to ToVinyl or Acceleration, but with more of a clipping effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Amount`: Adjusts the amount of smoothing applied to the signal.
    + Range: 0-100%
    + Type: Adjust to subtle for removing stray edges, aggressive for explosive effects
* `Output Level`: Sets the output level of the smoothed signal.
    + Range: -24.8 dB to +6.0 dB
* `Dry/Wet`: Blends the original and smoothed signals.
    + Range: 0-100%
    + Type: Increase dry for more original sound, increase wet for more smoothing

Best Use Cases:
* Softening spikes in audio signals, such as spikey acoustic guitars or overly edgy mics
* Cranking up large amounts of smoothing on drums to produce a huge explosive effect
