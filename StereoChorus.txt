StereoChorus

A basic stereo chorus plugin that simulates a traditional chorus effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Interpolation:` Selects the interpolation method.
	+ Adjust by selecting from a dropdown menu or using MIDI control change 0.
* `Chorus Speed:` Sets the speed of the chorus effect.
	+ Adjust using a knob, slider, or MIDI control change 1.
* `Depth:` Controls the depth of the chorus effect.
	+ Adjust using a knob, slider, or MIDI control change 2.
* `Stereo Spread:` Adjusts the panning or stereo imaging of the chorus effect.
	+ Interpolation Tricks: Uses staggered delay pairs with time offsets between left and right channels to create interesting stereo images.

Caveats:

* `Fixed Point Buffer:` Runs a fixed point buffer at a rather long word length, which may affect sound quality.
* `Dithering:` Modern dithering is applied only on 32-bit busses to reduce distortion.

Best Use Cases:
Use as a basic stereo chorus effect in situations where you want a simple, yet effective chorus sound. May be particularly useful when paired with other effects, such as reverb or delay.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust the Chorus Speed and Depth to find the sweet spot for your sound.
* Experiment with different Interpolation and Stereo Spread settings to achieve the desired width and imaging of the chorus effect.
* Pay attention to the fixed point buffer setting, as it may affect the overall sound quality.
