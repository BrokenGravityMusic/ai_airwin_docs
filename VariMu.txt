VariMu

A compressor plugin that uses different math (squaring the input signal) and handles brief transients differently compared to Pressure, resulting in a distinct sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Threshold: Adjusts the level above which compression occurs.
    + Range: [insert text]
    + Type: [insert text]
* Ratio: Determines the amount of compression applied.
    + Range: [insert text]
    + Type: [insert text]
* Attack: Time it takes for compression to kick in after a transient.
    + Range: [insert text]
    + Type: [insert text]
* Release: Time it takes for compression to return to normal after a transient has passed.
    + Range: [insert text]
    + Type: [insert text]
* Input Method: Can use either the signal alone or its square, changing the plugin's behavior.
    + Range: [insert text]
    + Type: [insert text]

Best Use Cases:
Suitable for compressing signals where brief transients need special handling. May be used as an alternative to Pressure or other compressors for unique sound characteristics.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the threshold and ratio controls according to your desired compression level. Experiment with different input methods to achieve the desired sound.
