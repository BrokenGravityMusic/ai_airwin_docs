ToTape5

Analog tape emulation plugin.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Louder`: Adjusts the overall level of the emulated tape. Defaults to 0.25, set to 0 for added purity.
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Type: gain control
* `Softer`: Controls treble softening, defaults to 0 (still on but very hi-fi). Turn up to get a more 'old' tape machine tone.
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Type: frequency response control
* `Fatter`: Emulates the head bump of analog tape, defaults to 0. Can be cranked up for extra roundness and fullness.
	+ Range: 0 to 1
	+ Type: tone control
* `Flutter`: Adds a subtle "spaciness" or "atmosphere" effect, defaults to 0 (off). Use small amounts (around 0.1) for realism.
	+ Range: 0 to 0.2
	+ Type: space/texture control

Caveats:
* Output should be adjusted if Fatter is boosted heavily to compensate for introduced low-end frequencies.
* Do not use Dry/Wet control in combination with Flutter, as it will create an unwanted flangey effect.

Best Use Cases:
ToTape5 is ideal for mixing and mastering music that requires a warm, authentic tape sound. It can be used on individual tracks or the entire mix to add depth and character.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust controls in small increments (around 0.1) to retain full fidelity of the mix.
* Turn down Output if boosting Fatter significantly.
* Use Louder, Softer, and Flutter settings in combination for a more realistic analog tape emulation.
