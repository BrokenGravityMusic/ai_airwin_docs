ToTape5

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Louder` (gain soak): controls level reduction due to tape saturation. Defaults to 0.25, can be set to 0 for added purity.
	+ Range: 0% to 1.00
	+ Type: Gain control
* `Softer` (treble softening): controls treble reduction. Defaults to 0, can be increased to 0.1-0.2 for a more "old" tape machine tone.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Gain control
* `Fatter` (head bump): controls low-end warmth and fullness. Defaults to 0, can be increased to 0.1-0.2 for emphasis on roundness and fullness.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Gain control
* `Flutter`: adds a subtle "spaciness" or "atmosphere" effect. Defaults to 0 (off). Use small amounts (around 0.1) for realism.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Control

Caveats:

* Output should be adjusted if Fatter is boosted heavily to compensate for introduced low-end frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
ToTape5 is ideal for mixing and mastering music that requires a warm, authentic tape sound. It can be used on individual tracks or the entire mix to add depth and character.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust controls in small increments (around 0.1) to retain full fidelity of the mix.
* Turn down Output if boosting Fatter significantly.
* Use Louder, Softer, and Flutter settings in combination for a more realistic analog tape emulation.
