ButterComp

A soft and smooth compressor that uses a unique, bipolar, interleaved compression method to achieve a distinctive tone with added second harmonics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Attack:` Sets the time it takes for the compression to respond.
* `Release:` Sets the time it takes for the compression to return to normal after a transient.
* Compression Factor: Adjusts the overall compression level.
* Slow Attack and Release: Enables slow attack and release for a more subtle compression effect. (available in CStrip)
* Interleaved Compressors: Four totally independent compressors per channel, two sensitive to positive swing and two to negative swing.

Best Use Cases:

* As a unique glue compressor for adding second harmonic tone to audio signals.
* For adding an airy openness to high frequencies.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with subtle adjustments to achieve the desired effect.
* Experiment with different compression factors and speed control to find the sweet spot.
* Use ButterComp in moderation, as it can produce unexpected results when pushed too hard.
