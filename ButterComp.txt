ButterComp

A soft and smooth compressor that uses a unique, bipolar, interleaved compression method to achieve a distinctive tone with added second harmonics.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Attack:` Sets the time it takes for the compression to respond.
	+ Type: Slow attack recommended
* `Release:` Sets the time it takes for the compression to return to normal after a transient.
	+ Type: Slow release recommended
* `Compression Factor:` Adjusts the overall compression level.
	+ Range: Subtle adjustments recommended
* `Speed Control`: Allows for adjusting the compression factor.

Caveats:

* Not suitable for normal compressor tasks; best used as a "glue" compressor.
* Can volume invert if slammed hard, resulting in quieter passages retaining their tone quality.
* Best results are achieved with subtle adjustments.

Best Use Cases:

* As a unique glue compressor for adding second harmonic tone to audio signals.
* For adding an airy openness to high frequencies.
* Ideal for delicate compression where you want to maintain the original sound quality.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different compression factors and speed controls to achieve the desired sound.
* Use ButterComp in moderation, as it can produce unexpected results when pushed too hard.
* Start with subtle adjustments to achieve the desired effect.
