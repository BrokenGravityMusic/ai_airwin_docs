Channel5

Insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:

* Output level control: allows for an extra level of control over the output signal (range 0.0 to 1.0)
	+ Setting Output to 1.0 bypasses the plugin's effects, making it identical to Channel4
* Live air denormalizing:
	+ A permanent noise signal is always present, unless the result with the signal is digital black, in which case it is subtracted again
	+ This creates a "live" silence that can be retained even when saving files in normal formats (e.g. 24-bit audio)
* Noise shaping:
	+ Accumulates and stores error energy over thousands of samples
	+ Applies this energy smoothly to the output audio, rather than interleaving it with the original signal
	+ A "pull-back" is applied per buffer to bleed away built-up energy

Caveats:

* The new noise shaping method may be imperceptible in double-blind tests
* Some users may prefer the original interleaved noise shaping method

Best Use Cases:

* To create a unique, "alive" silence rather than traditional dead silence
* To take advantage of the improved noise shaping approach for a more natural and seamless presentation of bass and mids

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Output levels to find the ideal balance between sound quality and denormalizing effect
* Consider using the pull-back factor to bleed away built-up energy and prevent distortion
