Channel5
`Control the output level, with an extra level of control over the output signal`
Key Controls and Settings:

* Output Level Control: 
	+ Range: 0.0 to 1.0
	+ Type: Controls the output level of the plugin

Live Air Denormalizing:
+ A permanent noise signal is always present, unless the result with the signal is digital black, in which case it is subtracted again
+ This creates a "live" silence that can be retained even when saving files in normal formats (e.g. 24-bit audio)

Noise Shaping:
+ Accumulates and stores error energy over thousands of samples
+ Applies this energy smoothly to the output audio, rather than interleaving it with the original signal
+ A "pull-back" is applied per buffer to bleed away built-up energy

Caveats:

* The new noise shaping method may be imperceptible in double-blind tests.
* Some users may prefer the original interleaved noise shaping method.

Best Use Cases:


Tips on Optimal Settings:


Setting Output to 1.0 bypasses the plugin's effects, making it identical to Channel4 except for the two features mentioned above.
