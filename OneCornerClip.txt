OneCornerClip

A full-bandwidth clipper that shapes the distortion to match the input signal's frequency balance.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Input Gain`: Adjusts the volume of the incoming audio.
* `Threshold`: Sets the maximum output level before clipping occurs.
* `Onset Control`: Slows down or speeds up the onset time of clipping.
* `Departure Control`: Adjusts the time taken for the waveform to snap back into place after clipping.
* `Clipping Type`: Selects between different clippage characteristics (e.g. bright and gritty, or brutal and ballsy).
* `Waveform Shaping`: Controls how the waveform is shaped when exiting clipping.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Should not be used for clean audio processing due to its distortion characteristics. May produce unpredictable results when used on transient-rich signals.

Best Use Cases:

Nasty industrial noise production Obliterating drum room tracks Creating big, fat, dirty distortions Adding size and scale to mixes

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use a ratio of 0.618 for general use to achieve a good range of tones. Experiment with different slope values or clipping types to find the desired tone shape. Be cautious when using this plugin on transient-rich signals due to its aggressive clipping characteristics.
