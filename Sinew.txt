Slew Clipper

insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold:` Adjusts the point at which the clipper starts to reduce high frequencies.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Slew:` Controls the rate at which the clipper reduces high frequencies as it approaches regular clipping.
	+ Low values: Slew clipping becomes more aggressive closer to regular clipping.
	+ High values: Slew clipping remains relatively gentle even close to regular clipping.

Caveats:
Due to its non-linear nature, slew clipping can produce unexpected effects when pushed to extreme values.
The plugin's behavior changes significantly depending on the slew value setting.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for making heavy guitars louder, adding grit to drums, or enhancing sounds with a tape bias-like quality.
Morphing percussive sounds
Adding a unique "grind" to instruments
Gluing stuff together into a retro sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with extreme Slew Threshold values to achieve interesting distortions.
Pay attention to the character of your sound as you adjust settings, and try to hear when it is subtly affecting the signal.
Also experiment with Threshold and Slew settings to achieve the desired effect.
