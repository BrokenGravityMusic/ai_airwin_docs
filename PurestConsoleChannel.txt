PurestConsoleChannel

A plugin that provides a clean dynamics encode/decode system without the tone-changing characteristics of other consoles.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Channels: inputSample = sin(inputSample)
	+ Strips down to simple amplitude encode/decode
* Buss: inputSample = asin(inputSample)
	+ Cancels out completely and doesn't touch the sound unless multiple channels are mixing

Properties:
- Goes for math functions which include complementary sin() and asin()
- Can be used in its capacity for 'expanding' verbs, delays, and EQs
- Strips down to simple amplitude encode/decode

Caveats:
Can easily clip with boosts and peaks.

Best Use Cases:
Use PurestConsoleChannel for expanding verbs, delays, and EQs. If there's no change, it'll cancel out to bit-identical fidelity.
