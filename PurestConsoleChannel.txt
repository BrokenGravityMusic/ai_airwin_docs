PurestConsoleChannel

A console system that provides a clean and free from coloration dynamics encode/decode functionality.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Channels: inputSample = sin(inputSample)
	+ Strips down to simple amplitude encode/decode
* Buss: inputSample = asin(inputSample)

Properties:
Cancels out completely and doesn't touch the sound at all unless multiple channels are mixing.
Goes to perfect bit-identical fidelity when only one channel feeds the buss.

Usage:
Use PurestConsoleChannel in its capacity for 'expanding' verbs, delays, and EQs. If there's no change, it'll cancel out to bit-identical. Then if you're doing stuff, it'll kick in.

Caveats:
Can easily clip with boosts and peaks, but this might sound OK to you.
Useful variations on Console 5 can be applied in the future.
