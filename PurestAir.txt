PurestAir

A brightness experiment that boosts or cuts air-band frequencies with a limiting factor to prevent excessive treble boost.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Boost/Cut:` Adjusts the air-band boost or cut.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Boost/Cut
* `Limit Intensity:` Sets the maximum intensity of treble before limiting occurs.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Threshold

Caveats:
* The plugin's limiting factor can make it difficult to hear what adjustments are being made.
* Adjusting the controls may not produce the expected results due to the unique interaction with the sample rate.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for situations where a precise air-band boost or cut is desired, and excessive treble needs to be controlled.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Approach adjustments slowly and carefully to avoid being overwhelmed by the plugin's limiting factor. Focus on subtle changes in frequency response rather than trying to make dramatic adjustments.
