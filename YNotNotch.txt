A biquad filter with texture-varying filtering capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `ResEdge:` A control that affects the sharpness of the filter edge.
	+ Range: 0% (softer tone) to infinite
	+ Type: Distortion control
* `Resonance:` A control that affects the resonant frequency of the filter.
	+ Range: 0% (flat response) to 100%
	+ Type: Resonance control
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
No control smoothing is applied, resulting in slightly more CPU efficiency but potentially more erratic behavior. The filter tone can become aggressively unnatural and glitchy at high ResEdge values.

Best Use Cases:
Fixed filter sound design, glitchy zipper-noise effects, tiny buffer sizes in VCV Rack or similar environments

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with the `ResEdge` control to find the desired level of distortion. Use the `Resonance` control to create extreme low/high cuts or ultra-shallow slope cuts.
