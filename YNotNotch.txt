YNotNotch

A biquad filter with texture-varying filtering capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `ResEdge:` Adjusts the sharpness of the edge in the filtered sound. Defaults to 0.1.
	+ Range: Can be lowered to 0 for a softer tone or turned up for a nastier edge
	+ Type: Controls distortion and resonance effects
* Resonance: Dials in the resonance level.
	+ Range: Can create an ultra-shallow slope cut or extreme low/high cut
	+ Type: Affects filter resonance

Caveats:
No control smoothing is applied, resulting in slightly more CPU efficiency but potentially more erratic behavior.

Best Use Cases:
Use for fixed filter sound design, glitchy zipper-noise effects, and tiny buffer sizes in VCV Rack or similar environments.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with the ResEdge control to find the desired level of distortion.
Use the Resonance control to create extreme low/high cuts or ultra-shallow slope cuts.
Be cautious when pushing the ResEdge value high, as it can lead to unpredictable filter behavior.
