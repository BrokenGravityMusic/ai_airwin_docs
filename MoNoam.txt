MoNoam

Switch around mid/side type things for convenience, providing variations on mono, mid, and side in different channels.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Mono/Mid/Side Split`: Choose from various split options:
	+ Mono: Single-channel mono.
	+ Mid: Center channel only.
	+ Side: Difference between the two channels.
	+ Mon-ized Side: Fuller-sounding side, phase-aligned with the mid channel.
* Channel Selection: Select which channel to output the selected option:
	+ Left Channel
	+ Right Channel
* Mono/Mid/Side Split (Direct): Outputs the mid or side component of a stereo signal directly.
* Mono-ized Side: Creates a fuller-sounding version of the side component by removing phase differences between channels.

Caveats:
Recombining different outputs from this plugin can result in unusual or undesirable effects.

Best Use Cases:
Use in situations where recombining mid/side signals is needed or when working with complicated signal routings, such as in Blue Cat Patchwork.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different split options and channel selections to find the best fit for your specific use case.
