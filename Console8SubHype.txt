Console8SubHype
An analog submix simulator with treble softening

insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:
* None. This plugin replaces Console8SubIn.
	+ Range: N/A
	+ Type: N/A

Caveats:
Replacing multiple stages of Console8SubIn/ChannelIn/BussIn will result in increased hyped and trebly sound.
Using on individual channels will have the most direct effect, while using on submixes or busses will change the tone of the entire mix.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating a brighter, sparklier sound in individual tracks, submixes, or the entire mix.
Use to add solidity and physicality to sounds, or ethereal spaceyness to create abstract textures.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Swap Console8SubHype in place of Console8SubIn for the desired effect.
Experiment with using Hype stages in different parts of your console (individual channels, submixes, buss) to achieve unique tonal results.
Pay attention to textural values like solidness, ethereal spaceyness, physical versus abstract, hard versus soft.
