Hype

A treble softening experiment gone awry, producing an unusual aural exciter effect.

Caveats:
* Stacking multiple instances can lead to distorted crackling effects
* Blending between Hype and other plugins (such as Console8 treble softening) is not recommended due to unpredictable results.

Best Use Cases:
Drop the plugin into your mix anywhere and observe its unusual effect. Experimenting with different settings and control combinations is also a good way to experience what it has to offer.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use caution when stacking multiple instances, as excessive use can lead to distortion.
