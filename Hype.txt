Hype

A treble softening experiment gone awry, producing an unusual aural exciter effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* None (plugin has no controls)
* External control settings may cause unpredictable behavior
* Oversampling may result in plugin or system instability

Caveats:
Unpredictable behavior when using external controls. Oversampling is not supported and may cause issues. Stacking multiple instances can lead to distorted crackling territory.

Best Use Cases:
Drop the plugin into your mix anywhere and observe its unusual effect. Use Hype in small quantities, either on its own or as a component of other plugins.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a single instance and adjust settings carefully. Avoid using external controls or oversampling. Be cautious when stacking multiple instances; use sparingly to avoid distortion.
