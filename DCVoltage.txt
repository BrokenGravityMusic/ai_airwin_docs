DCVoltage

An analog-style DC control voltage simulator, useful for creating and modulating control voltages in digital audio workstations (DAWs).

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Value:` Adjusts the level of the simulated DC voltage.
	+ Range: Adjustable to various levels
	+ Type: Slider
* `Meters:` Displays the current value of the simulated DC voltage, useful for metering and canceling out DC offsets.
	+ Range: Adjustable to display current value
	+ Type: Meter

Best Use Cases:

* Creating and modulating control voltages in a DAW for analog modular synthesizers or DC-coupled converters.
* Canceling out fixed DC offsets without altering bass frequencies through the use of metering and "DC servo" techniques.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To cancel out DC offsets, use metering to get an accurate reading, then adjust Value to compensate. This can be done using option/alt-dragging on the slider if supported by your DAW.
