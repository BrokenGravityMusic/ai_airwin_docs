DCVoltage

An artificial DC control voltage simulator

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Value`: Adjusts the level of the simulated DC voltage
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Meters`: Displays the current value of the simulated DC voltage, useful for metering and canceling out DC offsets
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]

Caveats:
Misusing this plugin can lead to damage caused by misapplying a DC-coupled system directly to woofers. Use with caution.

Best Use Cases:
* Creating and modulating control voltages in a DAW for analog modular synthesizers or DC-coupled converters.
* Canceling out fixed DC offsets without altering bass frequencies through the use of metering and "DC servo" techniques.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To cancel out DC offsets, use metering to get an accurate reading, then adjust Value to compensate. Bouncing files with a center-corrected section can help minimize sonic penalties when working with this plugin.
