DeBess


A high-end vocal de-esser that perfectly rejects non-essential audio frequencies.


Key Controls and Settings:

* Sample Comparison Window: A slider that controls the window size for sample comparison.
	+ Lower values: More similar to original DeEss, higher isolation of ess sounds.
	+ Higher values: Better rejection of faint softening in other content.
* Filter Control: Allows shaping a better EQ on targeted sibilance sounds.


Caveats:

* Low Sample Rate or Poor Mic: May not engage due to insufficient change between samples.
* High Treble Boosting: Can be challenging with high sample rates and bright vocal tracks. Try treble boosting before using DeBess for better results.
* Stage Mics and Lisp Effect: Not designed for taking stage mics; use on high-end vocal tracks for zero cost to other frequencies.


Best Use Cases:

* High-End Vocal Tracks: Ideal for de-essing only the ess sounds from high-quality vocal recordings.
* Treble Boosting: Use in conjunction with treble boosting for ultra-bright voice sound effects.


Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Brighten Before DeBess: Try brightening the signal before applying DeBess to achieve better results, especially at high sample rates.
* Filter Control and Sample Comparison Window: Utilize the filter control to shape a better EQ on esses rather than just trying to duck them, and adjust the sample comparison window slider to match the characteristics of your source material.
