DeBess

A high-end de-esser for vocal tracks that targets only sibilance sounds without affecting other content.

Key Controls and Settings:
* Sample Comparison Window: A slider that controls the window size for sample comparison.
	+ Range: Lower values provide more similar to original DeEss, higher isolation of ess sounds.
	+ Range: Higher values provide better rejection of faint softening in other content.
* Filter Control: Allows shaping a better EQ on esses, rather than just trying to duck them.

Caveats:
* May not work well with low-end equipment or high sample rates if mics do not extend right up as far as the sampling lets you.
* Should not be used for taking stage mics and making them lisp; it is designed for high-end vocal tracks.

Best Use Cases: De-essing vocals, especially those with high treble content.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Try brightening before using DeBess if struggling to get action at high sample rates.
* Adjust the Sample Comparison Window slider to match the characteristics of your source material and use the Filter Control to shape a better EQ on esses rather than just trying to duck them.
