`plugin for digital audio workstation with improvements in filtering, gain staging, and saturation`
Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain Control:` Default to 0.772 (unity gain), flexible staging allows pushing channels into the red while maintaining a smooth sound
	+ Range: -96 dB to +3 dB
	+ Type: Fader control
* `Mixing:` Channels now have dedicated seed values for dithering, each producing unique noise; ultrasonic filtering removes aliasing at every stage of processing

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing and mastering in digital audio workstations
* Creative mixing techniques that benefit from flexible gain staging and saturation/anti-saturation algorithm

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Use dedicated seed values for dithering to produce unique noise on each channel
* Employ ultrasonic filtering to remove aliasing at high sample rates (e.g., 192k)
* Adjust gain control to desired level, then use Fader controls to fine-tune saturation levels
