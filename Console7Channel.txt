Console7

A digital audio workstation plugin with improved mixing capabilities.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Ultrasonic Filtering:` Every stage now runs ultrasonic filtering to remove aliasing at high sample rates.
	+ Type: Gentle, less phase-smeary filter
* `Gain Staging:` Channels default to 0.772 on the gain control for "unity gain".
	+ Range: Adjustable via Fader controls
	+ Type: Flexible gain staging with saturation levels tied to gain
* `Dedicated Seed Values:` Each channel and buss has its own seed value for dithering.
	+ Type: Unique noise generation for each channel and buss
* `Saturation/Anti-Saturation Algorithm:` A blend of Spiral and Density algorithms for smooth onset of saturation and balanced harmonics generation.
	+ Range: Adjustable via gain staging

Caveats:
 
 None noted.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing with improved sound quality due to ultrasonic filtering
* Creative mixing techniques enabled by flexible gain staging

Tips on Optimal Settings:
 
 Push channels into the red for a smooth, non-edgy sound. Adjust saturation levels using Fader controls and take advantage of dedicated seed values for unique dithering.
