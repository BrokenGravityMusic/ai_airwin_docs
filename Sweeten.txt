Sweeten
--------

A plugin for generating second harmonic, similar to SingleEndedTriode and Inflamer (an artificial amp simulator).

insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Second Harmonic Amount`: A single control with stepped-control, bit-shift-gain functionality.
	+ Adjusting this control will increase or decrease the amount of second harmonic generated.
	+ The optimal setting is where it's doing its thing but at no point is it ever distracting or sticking out as a mixing mistake.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding subtle nonlinearity to a sound, particularly in the midrange section of an EQ. Can be used to enhance or sweeten sounds that lack this characteristic.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Turn up until you can hear it a little too well, then drop back a step. This will prevent overprocessing and ensure the plugin is doing its thing without being distracting.
