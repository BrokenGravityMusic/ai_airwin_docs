Sweeten

A plugin that generates super-clean second harmonic, similar to SingleEndedTriode and Inflamer (an artificial amp simulator).

Key Controls and Settings:

* Second Harmonic Amount: A stepped-control knob that determines the amount of second harmonic added to the audio.
	+ Turning it up will increase the warmth and sweetness. Note: The plugin uses bit-shift-gain technique to prevent overprocessing.
* Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Best Use Cases:

* Adding subtle nonlinearity to a sound or mix
* Enhancing the midrange section of an EQ
* Using in critical listening situations where a minimal, one-knob approach is desired

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Find the sweet spot where the second harmonic is noticeable but not distracting. Experiment with different settings to find the perfect balance for your mix.
