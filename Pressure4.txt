A compressor adjustable between vari-mu and 'new york' peak-retaining behaviors.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `µ-iness control:` Adjusts the compressive behavior, allowing for a range of dynamic effects.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Speed control:` Changes the rate at which the compressor responds to audio input, affecting texture and tone.

* `Linked stereo mode:` A special mode that uses diade bridges in hardware compressors to create a natural and fluid compression effect.

Caveats:
None noted.

Best Use Cases:

* Compressing individual tracks or buses for dynamic control
* Creating distinctive textures and tones using the µ-iness and speed controls
* Taking advantage of the linked stereo mode for natural and cohesive compression effects

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different µ-iness settings to find the perfect balance between dynamic effect and tone.
* Use the speed control to fine-tune the compressor's response time and create a range of tonal possibilities.
* When using linked stereo mode, pay attention to how the compressor responds to both channels, as this can greatly affect the overall sound.
