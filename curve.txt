curve

A pure, subtle compression effect with no gain or transition points, ideal for gentle level balancing.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold:` -60 dB to 0 dB
    + Range: -60 dB to 0 dB
    + Type: Control
* `Ratio:` Adjust the compression ratio from 1x to 10x
    + Range: 1x to 10x
    + Type: Control
* `Attack Time:` Control the time it takes for the compressor to respond to loud signals (1 ms to 100 ms)
    + Range: 1 ms to 100 ms
    + Type: Control
* `Release Time:` Set the time it takes for the compressor to recover after a signal has passed (10 ms to 500 ms)
    + Range: 10 ms to 500 ms
    + Type: Control
* `Makeup Gain:` Adjust the output gain to compensate for compression (-24 dB to 0 dB)
    + Range: -24 dB to 0 dB
    + Type: Control

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for gentle level balancing, subtle compression, and mixing/mastering applications where a pure, uncolored effect is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the ratio and threshold to taste, but keep the attack and release times relatively short (1-10 ms) to maintain a smooth, even response. Use makeup gain sparingly to avoid excessive amplification.
