PeaksOnly

A transformative mix check tool that telegraphs information about transient attacks, peak-limited sounds, and frequency balances.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Input gain: controls the level of the input signal
* Filter cutoff: sets the high-pass filter cutoff frequency for peaks-only processing
* Resonance: adjusts the Q-factor of the filters to affect the "color" of the output
* Phase rotation: rotates the phase of each filter stage to smear out transients across time
* Sane loudness level: allows you to set a target loudness level for the output signal

Caveats:
Be cautious when using PeaksOnly on mastered or highly compressed signals, as it may reveal unwanted characteristics. Excessively processing signals with PeaksOnly can lead to distortion and audio "porridge".

Best Use Cases:

* Balancing transient attacks in mixdown and mastering
* Identifying and correcting frequency imbalances in mixes
* Revealing hidden details in poorly mixed or compressed signals

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the filter cutoff to suit your specific needs for peak-limited sounds or transients. Experiment with resonance settings to change the "color" of the output.
