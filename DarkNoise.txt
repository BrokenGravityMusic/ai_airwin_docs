DarkNoise

Generates midrangey or bassier noise directly without filtering.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `List size:` The number of random values used to generate output.
	+ Adjusting this value affects the brightness of the top-end and overall tone.
* `Midrange control:` A setting that adjusts the midrange character of the noise.
	+ Lower settings produce a brighter, more trebly sound, while higher settings make it more bassy.
* `Gate threshold:` The level above which the output is gated (silenced) to prevent DC offset buildup.

Caveats:
Requires a significant amount of RAM to store the list of random values. Can be CPU-intensive due to the calculations required.

Best Use Cases:
Sound design for creating unique, algorithmic noise sources. Game development for generating background ambience or special effects. Live performance and remixing for adding unusual textures to tracks.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different list sizes and midrange control settings to achieve the desired tone. Adjust the gate threshold to prevent DC offset buildup and maintain a balanced sound.
