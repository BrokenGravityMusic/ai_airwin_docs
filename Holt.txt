A synth-like resonant lowpass filter focused on bass frequencies.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Cutoff Frequency:` Sets the frequency below which the filter begins to affect the audio.
    + Adjusting this control will make the plugin go from a sophisticated lowpass on upper mids and highs to an extreme low-frequency version.
* `Resonance:` Controls the peakiness of the filter's response at the cutoff frequency.
    + Higher resonance settings can make the plugin self-resonate.
* `Dry/Wet Control:` Mixes between the dry (unfiltered) audio and the filtered audio.
    + Can be used to tame the plugin's low-frequency madness.

Caveats:
The poles control can affect the overall processing load.

Best Use Cases:

* As a low-frequency synth-like resonant lowpass filter.
* As a sophisticated lowpass on upper mids and highs.
* As an extreme low-frequency version of Aura.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve the best results, experiment with adjusting the cutoff frequency, resonance, and dry/wet control to find the desired balance between bassiness and clarity.
