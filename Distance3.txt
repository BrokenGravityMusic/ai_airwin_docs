Distance3

A plugin that combines the best parts of Distance and Discontinuity, darkening sound and making it sound really far away.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Interleaved Stage Count: Adjusts the number of interleaved stages between Distance and Discontinuity processors
    + Increasing this value will combine the effects in a more interesting way, but may also increase computational demand
* Distance Gain: Adjusts the gain of the Distance processor
    + Use to balance the overall level of the effect
* Discontinuity Drive: Adjusts the drive of the Discontinuity processor
    + Use to control the amount of distortion and loudness added by Discontinuity

Caveats:
* Using high values for Interleaved Stage Count may increase computational demand
* Experiment with different settings to find optimal results for your specific use case

Best Use Cases:
* Convincingly making sounds seem far away when reverb and ambience are already accounted for
* Removing highs and accentuating rumble in various sound design applications

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start by adjusting the Interleaved Stage Count to find a balance between effect quality and computational demand
* Experiment with different Distance Gain and Discontinuity Drive settings to match your desired level of distortion and loudness
