C5RawConsole

Analog tone simulator with optional gentle DC suppression.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Centering Force`: A control that defaults to 0.0, which is the 'Xmas Morning' setting.
	+ Turning it up to 0.7 or 0.8 simulates the first bugfix, where some bass is removed to fix DC problems.
	+ Cranked up, it's a highpass with a gentle slope that can be used to tighten non-bass tracks.
	+ Keeping it at 0.5 or below reacts slowly and won't touch bass frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
* For users who want the original Console5 tone algorithm back.
* As a highpass filter with a gentle slope, especially for tightening non-bass tracks.
* To tune the dominance of subs without running an extra highpass.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Keep the Centering Force at 0.5 or below to avoid affecting bass frequencies.
* Crank it up to 1.0 for noticeable subs reduction.
* Use with caution and be aware of DC offset in your mix.
* Couple with other outboard DC correction filters if needed.
