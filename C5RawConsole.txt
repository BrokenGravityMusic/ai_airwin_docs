C5 Raw Console

Analog tone simulator with optional gentle DC suppression.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Centering Force`: A control that defaults to 0.0, which is the 'Xmas Morning' setting.
	+ Range: 0.0 (untamed) to 1.0 (highpass-like effect)
	+ Type: DC correction
	+ Adjusts the amount of DC correction, with higher values affecting low-end response
* `DC Suppression`: An optional feature that adds gentle DC suppression to the algorithm

Caveats:
* Be cautious when applying C5RawConsole and monitor voltage levels on tracks and buses.
* This plugin may give you signals that are bad for your gear if not handled correctly.
* It's recommended to use the final Console5, PurestConsole, or PDConsole instead, which have built-in DC handling.

Best Use Cases:
* For users who want the original Console5 tone algorithm back.
* As a highpass filter with a gentle slope, especially for tightening non-bass tracks.
* To tune the dominance of subs without running an extra highpass.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Keep the Centering Force at 0.5 or below to avoid affecting bass frequencies.
* Crank it up to 1.0 for noticeable subs reduction.
* Use with caution and be aware of DC offset in your mix.
