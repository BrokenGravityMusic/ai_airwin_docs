PDChannel

A plugin that combines Console5 and PurestDrive, offering a stage in every channel and on the buss.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Channel/Bus Select:` Choose between individual channels or the master bus.
* Each PurestDrive has its own dedicated control.
* Channel and buss can be swapped with any other Console5 plugin of the same type.

Caveats:
Using different Console variations for individual channels and the buss can result in an inconsistent sound. It's recommended to use the same ones for a cohesive mix.

Best Use Cases:
Suitable for applications where a lush, analog console sound is desired, such as:
* Mixing and mastering music that requires a warm, cohesive tone
* Creating a smooth, seamless soundstage in post-production

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve the best results, use the same Console5 plugin for channels to maintain consistency. Experiment with different PurestDrive settings to find the desired balance of warmth and clarity.
