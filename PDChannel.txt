PDChannel

A plugin that combines Console5 and PurestDrive, offering a stage in every channel and on the bus.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Channel/Bus Select`: Choose between individual channels or the master bus.
* `PurestDrive Stage`: Dedicated control for each stage, allowing tweaking of its characteristics.
* `Console5 Variant`: Utilize any other Console5 plugin of the same type as a direct swap-in.
* `Settings`: Configure channel EQ and other parameters using more normal tools.

Caveats:
Using different Console variations for individual channels and the bus can result in an inconsistent sound. It's recommended to use the same ones for a cohesive mix.

Best Use Cases:

* Analog warmth of the recording-console type: PDConsole is ideal.
* Lush, big-console sound: Consider other Console variations or plugins designed for these specific effects.
* Holographic imaging or great depth: Use the same channels and bus combination throughout.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Find an optimal combination of channels and bus that matches your preferences. Tweak channel EQ and other parameters using more normal tools to fine-tune the mix.
