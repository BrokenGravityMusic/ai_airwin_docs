TPFD Dither

Adds noise to the signal before conversion to help mask quantization errors and prevent "grating gnarlyness".

Key Controls and Settings:

* None: TPDFDither is a simple, high-resolution implementation of the TPDF algorithm that decorrelates two moments of quantization noise.
	+ Range: N/A (only supports 24-bit audio)
	+ Type: Noise injection
* Compatibility: Works on quad and 5.1 channels automatically, more efficient on mono channels.

Caveats:
Truncation can still cause issues if not done properly; best used in conjunction with other plugins for optimal results.

Best Use Cases:
Dithering is essential when converting high-resolution audio signals into lower-bit-depth formats; TPDFDither works well in most situations.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use TPDFDither without adjusting its settings or opening it in the DAW; this plugin should be used in a non-fiddly way for best results.
