A seven-stage ultrasonic filter designed to be used at high sample rates (e.g. 96k), providing a warm and analog tone while resisting aliasing.

Key Controls and Settings:
* Stage A-G: Seven stages of filtering, each with its own resonance value that can be adjusted.
	+ Type: Filter
	+ Range: Adjustable resonance values for each stage
* Mix: Placement across multiple stages is recommended

Best Use Cases:
* Mixing at high sample rates (e.g. 96k)
* Resisting aliasing and maintaining a warm, analog tone
* Constructing an in-house mixing board with custom filtering

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To get the best results from HypersonX, place one instance of each stage across your signal path, from input to final 2-buss. This will provide optimal filtering and prevent aliasing.
