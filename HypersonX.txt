HypersonX

A seven-stage ultrasonic filter designed to be used at high sample rates (e.g. 96k), providing a warm and analog tone while resisting aliasing.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Stage A-G`: Seven stages of filtering, each with its own resonance value that can be adjusted.
	+ To use: Place one instance of HypersonX at the input of your signal path (e.g. channel start), and then add additional instances at subsequent points in the mix (e.g. submixes, 2-buss).
* `Placement`: Can be placed at various points in the signal path, such as input, channel, submix, or 2-buss, to achieve the desired filtering effect.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Requires careful placement and arrangement across multiple stages of a signal path to achieve optimal results.

Best Use Cases:

* Mixing at high sample rates (e.g. 96k)
* Resisting aliasing and maintaining a warm, analog tone
* Constructing an in-house mixing board with custom filtering

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To get the best results from HypersonX, it's recommended to carefully arrange one instance of each stage across your signal path, from input to final 2-buss. This will provide optimal filtering and prevent aliasing.
