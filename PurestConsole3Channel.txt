PurestConsole3Channel

An alternate algorithm for minimalist Console, using a custom sin()/asin() implementation with bit shifts for fast calculation and preservation of mantissas.

Key Controls and Settings: 

Caveats:
Not optimized for non-oversampled processing (may be less CPU-efficient than other Airwindows Console versions)
May introduce a unique "sound" due to oversampling and bit-shift-based calculations

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for projects requiring fast, efficient processing with minimal CPU load. Suitable for use in conjunction with chain and individual FX oversampling.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use PurestConsole3Channel in conjunction with other Airwindows plugins that take advantage of oversampling capabilities (e.g., UltrasonX or HypersonX) to achieve optimal results. Experiment with different combinations and settings to suit your project's needs.
