Caveats:

The plugin is not meant for end listeners and does not affect the sound quality. Results may vary depending on mic placement, room acoustics, and earpiece positioning (if using open-ear headphones). Latency can still be an issue if monitoring through a DAW with plugins or into a big dense mix.

Best Use Cases:

Recording vocals without latency or headphones for better performance. Allowing singers to hear themselves as if singing a cappella.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Place the vocal mic exactly between the two speakers, pointed away from the speakers and towards the vocalist. Adjust EQ to compensate for room reverb and darkening if needed.
