Caveats:

Results may vary depending on mic placement, room acoustics, and EQ settings. The plugin is not meant for end listeners and does not affect the sound quality.

Best Use Cases:

Vocal tracking with monitor speakers or open-ear headphones, especially in situations with high latency or dense mixes.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Place vocal mic exactly between two speakers, perfect mirror image, pointed away from the speakers and towards the vocalist. Adjust EQ to compensate for room reverb and darkening if needed. Use heavy sturdy stand to lock mic in place for best results.
