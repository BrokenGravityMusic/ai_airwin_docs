TapeDust

A specialty plugin that adds treble-erode noise, specifically designed for creating natural-sounding crunch on sharp treble attacks and analog-style variance on repeated samples.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Level`: Adjusts the overall level of the noise.
    + Note: The plugin is sensitive to the type of signal being processed. Cranking up the Level may produce unexpected results.
* `Drive Control`: Boosts the noise level; turn up for more slam and dirt
* `Slew Rate/Slew`: Controls how aggressively the noise hits high frequencies or rapidly moving signals.

Caveats:

* The plugin has a bug that causes it to sound different than intended.
* This plugin is highly specialized and picky about what it likes to work on.
* It's not suitable for basses, full mixes (outside very low settings), or pure clear notes.
* Not recommended for use with pointy percussive atonal sounds, drums, loops, and sounds with bright highs.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding natural-sounding crunch to sharp treble attacks on percussive sounds.
* Creating analog-style variance on repeated samples.
* Textural experimentation by applying heavy TapeDust to specific elements in a mix.
* Converting ugly sharp treble attacks on pointy percussive atonal sounds to crunchy sounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Apply TapeDust judiciously, depending on the signal type and desired effect.
* Use high settings for percussive sounds, but be cautious of unusual effects.
* Experiment with different crossover/settings to find the optimal balance.
