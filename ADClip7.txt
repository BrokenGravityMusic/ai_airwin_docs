ADClip7

A loudness maximizer/peak control plugin that allows for maximum loudness without clipping artifacts.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Boost Control`: An interactive boost control that makes things louder.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Soften Control`: A control that manages high frequency entry and exit points, algorithmically reshaping the edges of clips to prevent digital glare and fizz.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Enhance Control`: A control that allows for a balance between clip and added reinforcements, with options for purely 'analog clip' energy or added highs-mids reinforcement.

	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Mode Selector (popup or multi-function control)`:
	+ `Normal Mode`: Boosts audio levels, excelling at snipping off non-tonal percussive peaks.
	+ `Gain Matched Mode`: Turns output down to set slam level without tricking the user into thinking louder is better. Can also be used with Youlean's loudness meter to dial in a specific intersample peak level.
	+ `Clip Only Mode`: Presents algorithm outputs combined, allowing for adjustments of softness and enhance level to balance added artifacts.

Caveats:

* ADClip7 should not be used as a limiter; use a limiter if dynamic flatness is required.
* Avoid over-slamming music with ADClip7 to prevent excessive clipping artifacts.

Best Use Cases:

* Pushing the loudness of dense, busy mixes to maximum levels.
* Mastering for streaming services or iTunes without compromising sound quality.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Use gain-matched mode to set slam level and maintain a specific intersample peak level.
* Adjust softness and enhance level in Clip Only mode to balance added artifacts.
