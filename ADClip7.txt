ADClip7

The ultimate Airwindows loudness maximizer/peak control for dense mixes and streaming services.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Boost Control`: A clipper that makes things louder.
* `Soften Control`: Manages high frequencies to prevent digital glare and fizz, balances energy-fill algorithms for bass and highs.
* `Enhance Control`: Lets you switch between "analog clip" energy and added reinforcements.
* `Mode Selector (popup or multi-function control)`:
    + `Normal Mode`: Boost makes things louder; Soften manages high frequencies to prevent digital glare and fizz.
    + `Gain-Matched Mode`: Used for setting the slam level or suppressing intersample peaks.
    + `Clip Only Mode`: Combines algorithm outputs at their respective loudnesses, with Softness and Enhance levels controllable.

Best Use Cases:

* Pushing loudness in dense mixes
* Mastering for streaming services (LUFS and intersample peak control)
* Adding punch and energy to flat mixes

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Use gain-matched mode for setting slam level or suppressing intersample peaks.
* Balance Soften and Enhance levels in Clip Only mode to avoid artifact predominance.
