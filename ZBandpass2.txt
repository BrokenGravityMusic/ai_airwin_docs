ZBandpass2


Emulates a bandpass filter with coefficient interpolation, similar to the Emu e6400 Ultra sampler.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Coefficient Interpolation:` Enables or disables coefficient interpolation for smoother performance.
	+ Type: On/Off
* `Input Level:` Adjusts the input signal level. Set to 0.1 for unity gain.
	+ Range: -20 to +20 dB
	+ Type: Gain control
* `Output Level:` Adjusts the output signal level. Use to pad or boost the signal as needed.
	+ Range: -20 to +20 dB
	+ Type: Gain control
* `Bandpass Filter:` Emulates the bandpass filter of an Emu e6400 Ultra sampler.


Caveats:

* May introduce distortion and zipper noise, especially when run at high levels.
* High levels of distortion and gain can be unstable if not handled carefully.

Best Use Cases:

* Ideal for creative sound design, effects processing, and simulating vintage hardware behavior.
* Adding smoothing and interpolation to bandpass filters in audio processing chains.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Keep input and output levels low when using distortion or high gain settings.
* Adjust coefficient interpolation as needed to balance smoothness with filter tone.
