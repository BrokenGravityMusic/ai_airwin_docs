ZBandpass2


Emulates a bandpass filter with coefficient interpolation, similar to the Emu e6400 Ultra sampler.


Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain:` Adjusts the overall gain of the plugin.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type:
* `Output Level:` Sets the output level, useful for padding the signal if needed. 0.1 gives unity gain.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type:
* `Input Level:` Sets the input level to prevent excessive gain or distortion.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type:
* `Coefficient Interpolation:` Enables or disables coefficient interpolation for smoother performance.
	+ Range: 
	+ Type:

Caveats:
May introduce distortion and zipper noise, especially when run at high levels.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creative sound design, effects processing, and simulating vintage hardware behavior.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Keep input and output levels low to avoid distortion and overload. Adjust coefficient interpolation as needed to balance smoothness with filter tone.
