GoldenSlew

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Slew`: Adjusts the amount of slew clipping applied by each stage.
    + Range: 0.0 - 1.0
    + Type: Control
    + Setting: Adjusts the amount of slew clipping.
* `Threshold`: The level above which slew clipping is applied.
    + Range: Unknown
    + Type: Control
    + Setting: Adjusts the threshold for slew clipping to kick in.
* `Chain Count`: The number of stages in the slew clipper chain.
    + Range: 1 - unknown (default: unknown)
    + Type: Control
    + Setting: Adjusts the number of stages used for slew clipping.

Caveats:
* Cranking the Slew control to 1.0 can result in sample and hold, which may be undesirable on audio signals.
* Using high Slew settings (> 0.5) can lead to undesirable effects like sample and hold on audio signals.
* Applying slew clipping as a chain produces a different effect than single-stage slew clipping.

Best Use Cases:
Use on drums, final mixes, or anywhere a unique distortion edge is desired. Apply to instruments or reverb sends to create a sense of distant loud sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Keep the Slew setting fairly low (less than 0.5) for controlling digital-ness without apparent volume reduction. Use with caution on audio signals, as high slew settings can result in sample and hold.
