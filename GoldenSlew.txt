GoldenSlew

A multistage slew clipper based on the Golden Ratio that darkens treble in an unusual way.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Slew`: Adjusts the amount of slew clipping applied by each stage.
	+ Range: 0.0 - 1.0 (default: unknown)
	+ Type: controls the amount of slew clipping
* `Threshold`: The level above which slew clipping is applied.
	+ Range: Unknown
	+ Type: sets the threshold for slew clipping to kick in
* `Chain Count`: The number of stages in the slew clipper chain.
	+ Range: 1 - unknown (default: unknown)
	+ Type: adjusts the number of stages used for slew clipping

Caveats:

* Cranking the Slew control to 1.0 can result in sample and hold, which may cause DC coupled speakers to produce distorted sound or is undesirable on audio signals.
* Using high Slew settings (> 0.5) can lead to unwanted effects like sample and hold.

Best Use Cases:

* Drum processing
* Final mix mastering
* Emulating analog consoles

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Keep the Slew setting fairly low (less than 0.5) for controlling digital-ness without apparent volume reduction.
* For analog emulation, keep Slew settings fairly low (< 0.5).
* Adjust the Slew control to taste for individual tracks or mixes.
