PurestConsole2Channel

A distributed filter version of PurestConsole that prevents aliasing by rolling off frequencies above 30k.

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Filter Start Frequency`: Set to 44 or 48k for optimal results.
	+ Range: Adjustable, but defaults to around 30k
* `Filter End Frequency`: Adjustable, but defaults to around 30k
* `Filter Sharpness`: Sharper filtering compared to Console7
* `Gain`: Adjust the overall gain of the plugin

Caveats:
Not suitable for very high frequencies (above 30k) due to aliasing prevention.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mixes that require a cool, airy clarity and resolution. Suitable for harmony vocal beds, orchestral stems, or summing busses.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use PurestConsole2Channel in the final stages of mixing to maintain transparency and resolution. Consider using Console7 for main mix and Console2Purest for summing busses or specific tracks.
