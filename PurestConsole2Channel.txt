A distributed filter version of PurestConsole that prevents aliasing by rolling off frequencies above 30k.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Start Frequency`: Set to 44 or 48k for optimal results.
* `Filter End Frequency`: Adjustable, but defaults to around 30k.
* `Filter Sharpness`: Sharper filtering compared to Console7.
* Gain: Adjust the overall gain of the plugin.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mixes that require a cool, airy clarity and resolution. Suitable for harmony vocal beds, orchestral stems, or summing busses.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use PurestConsole2Channel in the final stages of mixing to maintain transparency and resolution. Experiment with different filter thresholds and sharpness settings to achieve the desired level of clarity. Consider using Console7 for main mix and Console2Purest for summing busses or specific tracks. Run the plugin at 44k or 48k to avoid filtering frequencies beyond human hearing range.
