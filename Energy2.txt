Energy2

A high sample rate fixed-frequency treble boost plugin with an algorithm tied to the sample rate, providing CPU-efficient energy boosts.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `High Treble Boost`: Boosts high treble frequencies.
* `Upper Mid Boost`: Boosts upper mid frequencies, adding highs along with it.
* `Mixing Control (Inv/Dry/Wet)`: Combines sliders to get striking tone colors, with options for inverting phase, adjusting dry signal retention, and setting added energy levels.

Best Use Cases:

* Boosting treble frequencies for high sample rate applications.
* Adding aggression in high-mids for a more intense sound.
* Mixing with Inv/Dry/Wet control for optimal results.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Focus on one color at a time, adding or subtracting tones as needed. Crank out sliders to get obnoxious levels of boost and then use Inv/Dry/Wet to control the added energy.
