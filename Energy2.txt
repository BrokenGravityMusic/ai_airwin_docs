Energy2

A high sample rate fixed-frequency treble boost plugin with an algorithm tied to the sample rate, providing CPU-efficient energy boosts.

Key Controls and Settings:

* High Treble Boost: Boosts high frequency range (above 10k Hz) for added energy and air.

	+ Type: [insert text]
* Upper Mids: Adds aggression and body to mid-range frequencies (around 2-5k Hz).

	+ Type: [insert text]
* Inv/Dry/Wet:
	+ Invert: Inverts phase of added energy.
	+ Dry: Sets amount of original sound retained.
	+ Wet: Sets amount of added energy mixed with original sound.
	+ Range: [insert text]

Caveats:
Avoid combining sliders in ways that produce unpredictable tone colors, instead focus on one color at a time with minimal adjustments.

Best Use Cases:
Boosting treble frequencies for high sample rate applications and adding aggression in high-mids for a more intense sound.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Focus on one color at a time, adding or subtracting tones as needed. Crank out sliders to extreme levels and then use Inv/Dry/Wet to balance added energy.
