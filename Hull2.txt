Best Use Cases:


Broad-stroke EQ for musical tone shaping. Ideal for tracks that require subtle tonal adjustments.


Tips on Optimal Settings:


Use Hull2 as a simple gain control by moving all three controls together.
Experiment with boosting treble relative to mid for an even clearer 10k-centered boost.
Cutting treble relative to mid produces a soft notch, then increasingly steep roll-off.
