Hull2

A three-band EQ using the Hull algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Treble control: Adjusts high frequencies. Boosting relative to mid produces a 10k-centered boost without harmonics or alterations.
* Mid control: Central frequency control for treble and bass bands.
* Bass control: Adjusts low frequencies. Boosting relative to mid subtly cuts around 700 Hz, shifting the voicing of the track.

Best Use Cases:
Broad-stroke EQ for musical tone shaping. Ideal for tracks that require subtle tonal adjustments.
