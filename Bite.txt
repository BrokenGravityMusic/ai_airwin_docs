Bite

An unusual edge-maker that adds a midrange edge to audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Edge Control`: Adjusts the level of midrange edge added to or removed from the signal.
    + Turning clockwise adds a harshening factor, while counterclockwise reduces midrange edge.
* `Sample Rate Compensation`: Controls how much the edge is affected by high sample rates.
    + High sample rates produce a more trebly edge.

Caveats:

* Runs with a couple samples of latency.
* Not intended for standard audio processing, but rather as an experimental tool.

Best Use Cases:

* Experimental audio processing and sound design.
* Removing unwanted midrange edge from signals.
