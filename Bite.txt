Bite

Edge-maker plugin that adds or reduces midrange harshness in audio.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Edge Control:` Adjusts the level of midrange edge added to or removed from the audio signal.
	+ High settings: Increases treble and midrange harshness.
	+ Low settings: Reduces midrange edge.
* `Sample Rate Compensation:` Controls how much the edge is affected by high sample rates.
* `Latency:` Produces 2-3 samples of latency, equivalent to a delay effect in VST.

Caveats:
Runs with a couple samples of latency, which can affect VST plugin performance. Not intended for standard audio processing, but rather as an experimental tool.

Best Use Cases:
Experimental audio processing and sound design. Removing unwanted midrange edge from signals.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Edge Control to taste, and monitor the effect at various sample rates to achieve the desired edge character.
