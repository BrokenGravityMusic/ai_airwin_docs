ToneSlant

A super-transparent 'tilt EQ' with very low Q that produces an extremely transparent tone with a controllable corner point.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Taps: Sets the number of samples in the average block (range: 1-100).
	+ Range: 1-100
	+ Type: sets the corner point of the tilt EQ response
* Highs: Controls the brightness of the highs, with values ranging from -1 to +1.
	+ Range: -1 to +1
	+ Type: adjusts the frequency response of the tilt EQ
* Dry/Wet Control: Allows for moderation of the effect by adjusting the blend between the original signal and the ToneSlant output.

Caveats:
ToneSlant is a low-pass filter that can introduce cancellation nodes, affecting tone and timbre. Applying extreme values to Taps and Highs can lead to unintended effects.

Best Use Cases:
* Extremely low Q treble rolloff above a set point with fixed dB/oct response
* Total cancellation of high frequencies
* Natural high-shelf controllable EQ

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Be cautious when applying ToneSlant, as it can "hide" and affect tone and timbre unexpectedly. Use ToneSlant for strong 'tilt' effects without equalizing the sound.
