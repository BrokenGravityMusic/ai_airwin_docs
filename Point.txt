Point

Transient designer for explosive effects on audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Input Trim: Adjust input level (-1.0 to 1.0, dry = 0.0)
* Point control: Design transient effect (range: -1.0 to 1.0)
	+ Range: 
* Reaction Speed: Control reaction speed (range: 0.0 to 1.0)

Caveats:
Can produce unstable and intense effects if settings are pushed too high.
Operating at high Point settings can result in unstable behavior and potentially damage your ears.

Best Use Cases:
Squishing snare drum fronts for a huge effect
Spotlighting cymbal attacks while rounding drums
Hype up kick drum attacks and suppress sustain

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For squishing snaredrums, use Point -1.0 and reaction speed 0.166.
To spotlight cymbals, use Point -1.0 and reaction speed 0.14.
To hype up kick drums, use reaction speed 0.3 and carefully add positive Point until desired effect is achieved.
