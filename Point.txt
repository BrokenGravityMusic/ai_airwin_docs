Caveats:
Can produce unstable results when pushed too far, and may damage audio or ears if misused.

Best Use Cases:

* Squishing snare drum fronts for a huge sound.
* Spotlighting cymbal attacks while rounding drums.
* Hype up kick drum attacks and suppress sustain.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For squishing snaredrums, use Point -1.0 and reaction speed around 0.166. For spotlighting cymbals, use Point -1.0 and reaction speed around 0.14. To hype up kick drums, use a reaction speed of around 0.3 and carefully add positive Point.
