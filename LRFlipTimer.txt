LRFlipTimer

Swaps Left and Right audio channels every few (1-10) minutes, sweeping them across in about a tenth of a second to prevent pops.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Swap Interval`: Set the number of minutes between swaps (1-10)
	+ Range: 1-10 minutes
	+ Type: Timer
* `Sweep Time`: Adjust the time taken for the swap operation (~0.1 seconds)

Caveats:
Not intended for use in mixdown, but rather as a tool for testing asymmetric mixing.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for solo artists, musicians, or sound designers who want to check the balance of their audio material by flipping channel assignments.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Set a reasonable Swap Interval based on your workflow. For best results, minimize Sweep Time to prevent audible clicks during swaps.
