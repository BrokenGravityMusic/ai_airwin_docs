CStrip

A three-band EQ with unique characteristics, a gate with a release designed to pull audio back into the sound picture, and a compressor using the ButterComp algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `3-Band EQ`: 
  + Top band: Boosting extreme highs adds aggressiveness for heavy boosts (uses Energy plugin)
  + Mid band: Normal EQ behavior
  + Low band: Normal EQ behavior
  + Crossover frequencies: Adjustable to blend bands together
* `Gate`:
  + Release designed to pull audio back into sound picture, not just volume-ramp it
  + Adjustable threshold and ratio settings
* `Time delay control`: 
  + Used for micro-delay relative to other tracks for groove purposes
* `Compressor (ButterComp)`:
  + Uses ButterComp algorithm with interleaved sample compression in Class AB
  + Speed control allows odd compression behaviors, such as increasing speed hugely

Caveats:

* Heavy compression can produce artifacts
* Using extremes on highpass and lowpass filters can switch off and bypass math operations

Best Use Cases:

* Channel strip for general audio processing
* Sonic destruction and creative effects
