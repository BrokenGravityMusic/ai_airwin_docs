CStrip

A three-band EQ with highpass and lowpass filters, gate, time delay, and compressor, utilizing the ButterComp algorithm.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `3-Band EQ`: 
	+ Top band: Boosting extreme highs adds aggressiveness
	+ Mid band: Standard EQ response
	+ Low band: Boosting lows enhances low-end presence
	+ Crossover frequencies: Adjustable to blend bands together
* Highpass and lowpass filters:
	+ Frequency: Cuts or boosts frequencies below/above this value
	+ Mode (Extreme): Switches to a special algorithm that 'traps in' already bandlimited sounds
* Gate:
	+ Threshold: Sets the level above which the gate is active
	+ Attack: Adjusts how quickly the gate responds to changes in volume
	+ Release: Pulls the audio back into the sound picture after it has been gated
* Time delay control: Micro-delay gives the track a micro-delay relative to other tracks for groove purposes
* Compressor (ButterComp):
	+ Ratio: Sets the amount of compression applied to the signal
	+ Threshold: Sets the level above which compression is applied
	+ Attack and Release: Adjusts how quickly the compressor responds to changes in volume

Caveats:
Cranking the speed control on the compressor under heavy compression can produce artifacts. Keep the speed low for normal behavior.

Best Use Cases:
Use CStrip as a channel strip plugin with an EQ, gate, time delay, and compressor. It's ideal for tracking and mixing.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For best results:
* Adjust the 3-Band EQ to taste
* Set the highpass and lowpass frequencies according to your audio material
* Use the gate to control dynamics and maintain a clean sound
* Experiment with the time delay to create interesting spatial effects
* Use the compressor to add punch or even out dynamics
