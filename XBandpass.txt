XBandpass
A digital equalizer with a bandpass filter response, inspired by retro sampler Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

Key Controls and Settings:
* `Frequency`: Adjusts the center frequency of the bandpass filter. Range: 20 Hz to 20000 Hz.
    + Type: Adjustable Frequency Control
* `Q Factor`: Sets the resonance or "Q" factor of the filter, affecting its peakiness. Range: 0.1 to 10.
    + Type: Adjustable Q Control
* `Gain`: Controls the overall level of the filtered signal. 
    + Type: Gain Control
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original.
    + Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
* May produce zipper noise when adjusting settings on the fly due to its CPU-efficient design.

Best Use Cases:
* Use in creative audio processing scenarios where a specific frequency range needs emphasis or attenuation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust Frequency and Q controls to suit the desired filtering response.
* Be cautious with high Q values, as they can introduce excessive resonance. 
* For best results, experiment with different settings to achieve the desired sound.
