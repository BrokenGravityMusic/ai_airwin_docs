XBandpass

A band pass filter with a distorted tone inspired by retro sampler DSP, simulating a unique, filtered sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Frequency`: Adjusts the center frequency of the bandpass filter.
	+ Range: 10 Hz to 20 kHz
	+ Step size: Adjustable
* `Q Factor`: Adjusts the bandwidth of the band pass.
	+ Range: 0.1 to 10
	+ Step size: Adjustable
* `Distortion Amount`: Controls the amount of distortion applied to the filter output.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Step size: Adjustable

Caveats:

* May produce zipper noise when adjusting settings on the fly due to its CPU-efficient design.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding a unique, distorted tone to specific frequency ranges in audio signals.
* Emulating retro sampler DSP characteristics in audio processing.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust Frequency and Q Factor to target specific frequency ranges for optimal band pass filtering.
* Balance Distortion Amount to achieve the desired level of distortion in the filter output.
