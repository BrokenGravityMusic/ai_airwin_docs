FromTape

A minimalist analog tape emulation that provides transparent treble softening without distortion.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Weight (Highpass):` A filter with adjustable cutoff frequency to control bass level.
	+ Range: 
	+ Effect: Cuts bass in a way that can increase the overall output level by up to 3dB.
* `Softer:` A saturation control to soften digital edges.
	+ Range: 
	+ Effect: Softens peaks without introducing distortion, except when cranked to its maximum setting.
* `Output Level Control:` Allows for buffering and adjusting the output level after processing.

Caveats:
Clipping to a set level is only possible with the Softer control at its maximum setting.
Using FromTape can result in increased output levels due to the highpass filter's effect on bass frequencies.

Best Use Cases:
Channel and bus processing: Suitable for use on individual tracks or groups where ToTape would be too heavy.
Mastering: Can be used to soften digital edge while retaining clarity.
Mixing: Can help take an overlimited mix and make the bass rounder and more open, giving a little crest factor back.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different Weight settings to find the optimal highpass cutoff frequency for your specific signal.
Adjust Softer to taste, taking care not to overdo it as this can result in an undesirable sound.
Use the output level control to buffer the signal and prevent bass cut levels from increasing by too much.
