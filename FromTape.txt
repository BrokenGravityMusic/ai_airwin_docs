FromTape

A minimalist analog tape emulation that provides transparent treble softening and adjustable highpass filtering.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Softer`: Adjusts the level of softening applied to the input signal.
    + Range: 
    + Type: Treble softening control
* `Weight (Highpass)`: Adjusts the cutoff frequency of a resonant highpass filter, cutting bass frequencies in such a way that they might be louder after processing.
    + Range: 
    + Type: Highpass filter control

Caveats:
Cranking Softer to its maximum setting can result in clipping and an unpleasant sound. The highpass may cause clean unclipped bass pre-FromTape to become 3dB louder post-processing, requiring additional gain reduction or buffering.

Best Use Cases:
Channels where a heavy plugin like ToTape is not feasible. Mixing and mastering applications where subtle treble softening and adjustable highpass filtering are desired. Enhancing the tonality of an overlimited mix by adding roundness and openness to the bass.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Use Softer to taste, but avoid cranking it to its maximum setting for best results. Adjust Weight (Highpass) according to the specific audio material being processed. Employ output level control as necessary to prevent clipping or adjust gain staging.
