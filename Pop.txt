Key Controls and Settings:

* `Threshold`: Sets the level above which compression begins. Adjust carefully to achieve desired effect.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Ratio`: Determines the amount of compression applied. Higher ratios produce more extreme effects.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Attack`: Controls how quickly the compressor responds to changes in signal level. Short attacks can create a "bursting" effect.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Release`: Sets how long it takes for the compressor to recover after a transient has passed. Longer releases can produce a "smashed" sound.
	+ Range: [insert text]
	+ Type: [insert text]
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%

Caveats:
Requires careful setting of threshold and ratio to avoid producing unwanted effects such as backwards decay or distortion.
May not be suitable for all types of audio, particularly loud or complex signals.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating unique, overcompressed sounds reminiscent of 80s Genesis and Phil Collins productions. Suitable for use on individual tracks or in mixing situations where a distinctive sound is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different attack and release times to achieve the desired effect.
Pay attention to threshold and ratio settings to avoid over-compression or distortion.
Consider using Pop as part of a larger processing chain to create complex, textured sounds.
