Exciter
Simulates an aural exciter effect by adding subtle to extreme transients and distortion to audio signals

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Frequency`: Adjusts the frequency band used for extraction (Hz)
	+ Range: Hz
	+ Type: Frequency control
* `Amount`: Controls the intensity of the effect (0-100%)
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Intensity control
* `Soft Clip`: Soft clipping function for distorting extracted frequencies (sin() function or similar)
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Distortion type
* `Band Filter`: Sharp band filter for extracting certain types of information
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Filtering type

Caveats:
Cranking up the effect too much can lead to obvious crunch and distortion. Best used in moderation to maintain a "late seventies heightened detail" tone.

Best Use Cases:
Adding subtle transients to quiet signals, creating gritty, evil distortion for effect on bright or excitable sources, experimenting with unique tones by misusing transistors and chips (analog-style).

Tips on Optimal Settings: Fine-tune the effect in small increments to achieve desired results. Be cautious not to overdo it, as excessive distortion can be unpleasant.
