uLawEncode

insert one-line description

Key Controls and Settings:

* Gain control: Adjusts the overall level of the encoded signal.
	+ Default value: 1.0
* Wet/Dry control: Controls the amount of encoded signal blended with the original audio.
	+ Default value: 1.0
* Mode: Selects the type of uLaw compression to apply (not specified)

Caveats:
This plugin is designed for use with a bitcrusher or other plugins that can help tame the distorted signal.

Best Use Cases:

* As part of a console-like encode/decode pair with bitcrushers
* As a distortion plugin to create unusual sounds

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Typical configuration: insert a bitcrusher (such as DeRez) between uLawEncode and the next processing step for cleaner results.
