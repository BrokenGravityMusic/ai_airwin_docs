GrooveWear

A plugin that simulates high-frequency rolloff using a stylus-like effect, averaging slews (the rate of change) of audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Intensity`: Adjusts the amount of slew averaging applied to each stage.
* `Dry/Wet Stage 1-4`: Specify how much wet signal is mixed with the dry signal at each stage.
* `Stages` (default: 4): The number of processing stages used for the effect.

Caveats:
None noted.

Best Use Cases:
Use GrooveWear for scrubbing highs off mechanically, like a stylus would. Suitable for tone-softening and simulating vinyl wear.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Intensity control to specify how much slew averaging is applied, or use the Dry/Wet control to balance the effect's intensity. Experiment with different Stage settings to find the optimal balance between frequency range control and overall effect depth.
