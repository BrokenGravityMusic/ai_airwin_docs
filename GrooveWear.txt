GrooveWear
-----------

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Intensity`: Controls the amount of slew averaging done by each stage.
* `Dry/Wet`: A control for adjusting the amount of effect added progressively across four stages. Increases from pristine to deep groove wear.
    + Specify how much wet signal is mixed with the dry signal at each stage.
* `Stage`: The number of processing stages used for the effect (default: 4).

Best Use Cases
Use GrooveWear for scrubbing highs off mechanically, like a stylus would. Suitable for tone-softening and simulating vinyl wear.

Tips on Optimal Settings
Adjust the intensity control to specify how much slew averaging is done by each stage. Adjust the dry/wet control to mix more stages of wet signal with the dry signal, starting from pristine to deep groove wear.
