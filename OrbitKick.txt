Best Use Cases:
Ideal for generating deep bass sounds and reinforcing kick drums in music production. Suitable for use in a variety of genres, including electronic dance music (EDM) and hip-hop.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with Shape to find the perfect balance between attack and decay.
* Be cautious when using high settings for Drop and Thresh, as this can lead to unstable or "scruffy" note triggering.
