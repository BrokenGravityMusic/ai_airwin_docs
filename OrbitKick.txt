Plugin Name: OrbitKick
Function Overview: Bass generator and kick drum reinforcer.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Drop: Adjusts the rate at which the note drops, from "not at all" to very quick.
* Shape: Tapers the attack of the note, affecting its punchiness.
* Start: Sets the initial amplitude of the attack, in conjunction with Thresh.
* Thresh: Threshold at which the note is triggered.
* Finish: Cuts off the note, set low for clicky releases.

Caveats:
* Does not sound like a sample; produces living bass-like effects.
* Will produce unpleasant noises if input sound lacks a distinct attack.
* May not work as intended on low-fidelity playback devices, such as laptops or cellphones.

Best Use Cases:
* Adding deep bass to percussive sounds
* Creating thump or "pewww!" laser sounds

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* For shorter kicks, adjust Drop, Start, and Finish accordingly.
* Experiment with Shape to find the perfect balance between attack and decay.
