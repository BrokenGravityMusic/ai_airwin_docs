FinalClip

A specialized clipper designed to apply +6 dB clipping to video audio in Final Cut Pro, with subtle slew-clipping for treble softening.

Key Controls and Settings:

* None (this is a simple, one-stage clipper)

Caveats:

Best Use Cases:

* Preconditioning peaks before applying a peak limiter to the mix buss
* Softening loud voice outbursts and softening treble information for video recording

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Run camera audio directly to Final Cut output for best results. Using this plugin in combination with other Airwindows clippers (such as ClipOnly2 or ADClip8) to achieve desired results.
