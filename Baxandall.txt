A general-purpose EQ with a two-band filter that allows for subtle, gentle boosts or cuts in both low and high frequencies, centered on the midrange.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Lowpass:` A boost or cut control adjusting low-frequency response.
    + Range: -∞ to +3 dB (or more)
    + Type: Low-pass filter
* `Highpass:` A boost or cut control adjusting high-frequency response.
    + Range: -∞ to +3 dB (or more)
    + Type: High-pass filter
* `Boost/Cut Amount:` Determines the intensity of tonal shaping, from subtle to extreme.
    + Range: 0% to 100%
    + Type: Boost/cut control
* `Midrange Notch:` Affects midrange frequency response, developing a notch as boosts become more intense.
    + Range: -∞ to +3 dB (or more)
    + Type: Midrange filter

Caveats:
Using extreme boosts may develop an inverse lowpass effect, resulting in a mids notch. Double boosts or extreme cuts may require additional adjustments to achieve desired results.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for general-purpose EQing, subtle frequency adjustments, and creating extreme EQ treatments without sounding "filtery".

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To achieve natural sound, boost or cut frequencies subtly. For more intense boosts, use midrange notch to notch and accentuate the boosting effect. Start with gentle boosts and cuts to achieve desired tonality.
