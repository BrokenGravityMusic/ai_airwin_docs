PurestWarm2

Adds softest-possible-saturation effect to one side of the waveform while passing through the exact bits that came in on the other half.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Side 1 Dry/Wet Control`: Adjusts the amount of saturation applied to the positive side of the waveform, ranging from 0 (bypass) to 100% (full saturation).
	+ Range: 0-100%
	+ Type: Percentage
* `Side 2 Dry/Wet Control`: Adjusts the amount of saturation applied to the negative side of the waveform, ranging from 0 (bypass) to 100% (full saturation).
	+ Range: 0-100%
	+ Type: Percentage

Caveats:
Saturation may introduce second harmonics.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding subtle warmth and texture to waveforms, especially electric bass guitars where the string swings near the pickup. Sweetening waveforms that need a little texture added without affecting frequency or EQ. Bass tone optimization.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Side 1 and Side 2 Dry/Wet Controls independently to massage both sides of the waveform to taste. No way to perfectly integrate bypass and effected halves; they switch off like a push-pull power amp.
