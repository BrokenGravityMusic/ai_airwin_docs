PurestWarm2

Adds softest-possible-saturation effect to one side of the waveform while passing through the exact bits that came in on the other half.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Side 1 Dry/Wet Control`: Adjusts the amount of saturation applied to the positive side of the waveform, ranging from 0 (bypass) to 100% (full saturation).
	+ Low values: minimal or no effect
	+ High values: maximum saturation
* `Left Dry/Wet`: Controls the amount of saturation applied to the positive half of the waveform.
	+ Low values: minimal or no effect
	+ High values: maximum saturation
* `Right Dry/Wet`: Controls the amount of saturation applied to the negative half of the waveform, ranging from 0 (bypass) to 100% (full saturation).
	+ Low values: minimal or no effect
	+ High values: maximum saturation

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding subtle warmth and texture to waveforms, especially electric bass guitars where the string swings near the pickup.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust Left Dry/Wet and Right Dry/Wet independently to find the optimal balance for each waveform. Start with subtle settings (30-40% dry/wet) and adjust as needed for optimal results.
