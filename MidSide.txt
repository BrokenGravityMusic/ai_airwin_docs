MidSide (mid/side conversion utility plugin)

A mid/side conversion utility plugin for converting stereo tracks into mid/side format and back.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Mid/Side Balance`: A control for balancing the mid and side content, allowing gain staging of M/S content.
    + Adjusting this control can gain stage the M/S content into your plugin or reverse the gain staging applied by EdIsDim
* Gain Staging: Allows reversal of gain staging applied to mid/side content.

Best Use Cases:

* Mid/side conversion for processing and recombination
* Saturating center content with Density while maintaining stereo width
* Fresh takes on stereo reverbs
* Funky routing techniques in DAWs, such as sending L and R to separate busses

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different mid/side balances to achieve desired effects. Use with Density to saturate the center and maintain stereo width.
