Open-sounding compressor with unique sound, providing compression with bass bloom capabilities

Key Controls and Settings:

* Compressor controls: adjust to shape dynamics
	+ Range: varies depending on compressor settings
	+ Type: simultaneous two-and-three-sample-interleaved compressors
* Bass Bloom control: passes subsonics or bass notes through uncompressed
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: variable, dependent on desired low-frequency content

Caveats:

May behave unexpectedly when used in certain scenarios, such as sine sweeps. Can produce unusual behavior when used with other compressors or signal generators.

Best Use Cases:

Ideal for applications where a unique compressor sound is desired, and for producing transparent dynamics control. Can also be used to create interesting effects by exploiting its quirks.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Experiment with different compressor settings to achieve the desired sound. Be cautious when using the Bass Bloom control, as it may pass low-frequency content uncompressed. Adjust the compressor algorithm as a starting point for dynamic control, and use the bass bloom control to tighten low-end response or pass desired subsonics through uncompressed.
