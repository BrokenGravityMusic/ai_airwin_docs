Key Controls and Settings:

* Compressor controls: adjust to shape dynamics
	+ Type: simultaneous two-and-three-sample-interleaved compressors
* Bass Bloom control: allows passing subsonics or bass notes through uncompressed
	+ Range: variable (to taste)
	+ Type: pass-through control

Best Use Cases:

* Transparent dynamics control for maintaining transparency
* Boosting low-end frequencies with bass bloom control
* Tightening low-end response with bass bloom control

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust compressor to taste for optimal compression level. Experiment with bass bloom control to pass through desired subsonics or bass notes.
