Golem

A stereo track blender that allows balancing inputs and applying delay to one side.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Input Balancer: Adjusts the relative levels of the left and right channels.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Control
* Delay Control: Applies a delay to either the left or right channel, allowing for fine-tuned phase relationships between mics.
	+ Delay Amount: Sets the amount of delay applied to the selected side
	+ Range: Option to increase the range of available delays
	+ Type: Control
* Invert Channel: Option to invert one channel

Caveats:

* Fine-tuning is required for optimal results.
* Delays are subsample-based, allowing for precise phase relationships between mics.

Best Use Cases:

* Blending two microphones on an amp, particularly in metal music.
* Tuning mic cancellations for specific tone adjustments.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the input balancer to balance the levels of the left and right channels.
* Experiment with different delay amounts and types to achieve desired cancellations and tone shaping.
