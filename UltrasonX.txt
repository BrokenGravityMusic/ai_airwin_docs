UltrasonicX

A plugin that allows you to use any one of the five stages in Ultrasonic, one at a time, with settings for A, B, C, D, and E stages.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Stage Select`: Choose which stage (A-E) to use.
* `Resonance Value` (for each stage): Set the resonance value for each stage (A-E)
* `Number of Instances`: Decide how many instances of UltrasonX to use in a signal path, from 1 to 5.

Best Use Cases:

* Constructing a Console system where channels aren't overly brightening, but feeding a submix buss that is more crunchy.
* Using as pre-brightening or complementary darkening filters in a signal path.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different stage combinations and resonance values to achieve the desired tone.
* Use multiple instances of UltrasonX in a signal path for a Console topology effect.
* Place UltrasonX before distortion for a more resonant sound, or after distortion for a softer, more compensating effect.
