EverySlew

A versatile treble processing plugin with various sound shaping tools, offering Slew, GoldenSlew, PlatinumSlew, and combinations thereof.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Depth control: Regulates the number of stages in the effect (0.1 to 10), equivalent to GoldenSlew or PlatinumSlew at full crank.
	+ Range: 0.2-0.3 for taking off only the brightest highs
	+ Type: Number of stages
* Halo control: Introduces attenuation into deep bass and creates a sparkly, energetic sound.
	+ Range: Low settings (less than 0.5) to avoid introducing distortion
	+ Type: Attenuation
* Dry/Wet control: Offers an Inv/Dry/Wet mix setting for monitoring the clipping only.
	+ Mix: A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original, range from 0% to 100%

Caveats:
High settings may result in significant distortion or unwanted effects; can be CPU-intensive.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for taming unruly high frequencies, processing sounds that require a unique sound effect, or using Halo for aggressive noise creation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with fewer stages (2-3) to find optimal CPU load balance; keep Halo settings low (0.x) for realistic results and avoid significant distortion.
