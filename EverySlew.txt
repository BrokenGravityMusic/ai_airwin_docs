A versatile treble processing plugin with various sound shaping tools, offering Slew, GoldenSlew, PlatinumSlew, and combinations thereof.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Depth control:
	+ Regulates the number of stages in the effect
	+ Full crank equivalent to GoldenSlew or PlatinumSlew
	+ Fewer stages for lighter CPU load and less 'golden' effect (optimal range: 0.2-0.3)
* Halo control:
	+ Introduces attenuation into deep bass and creates a sparkly, energetic sound
	+ Best used with low settings (less than 0.5) when Slew is noticeable
	+ High settings produce a unique, aggressive distortion
* Dry/Wet control:
	+ Offers an Inv/Dry/Wet mix setting for monitoring the clipping only
	+ Dry = 0.5; Inv cancels out dry signal and shows slew clipping

Caveats:
Can be CPU-intensive; high settings may introduce significant distortion or unwanted effects.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for sound designers and engineers seeking unique treble processing tools, developers of analog desk emulations, and vintage-inspired sounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with fewer stages (2-3) to find optimal CPU load balance. Keep Halo settings low (less than 0.5) for realistic results and avoid significant distortion.
