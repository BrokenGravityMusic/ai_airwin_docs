Dubly

Simulates the retro vibe of classic noise reduction processing, adding a magical aura to audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Level`: Adjusts the overall level of the processed signal.
* `Retro Vibe (Distortion)`: A simple distortion stage that adds harmonics and treble energy to the sound (default: 0.5).
	+ Range: Turning up the Retro Vibe control can add a hyped, intensified zone to the audio, with increased treble energy.
* `Filter`: A low-pass filter used to simulate the frequency response of vintage noise reduction systems.
	+ Range: Sets the cutoff frequency of the filter (default: 100 Hz).
* `Gain`: Adjusts the overall gain of the distorted signal.

Caveats:

* Mis-calibrating the Retro Vibe control can lead to an over-processed sound.
* Using high settings for Distortion and Gain can lead to an overly bright, hyped sound.
* The plugin does not emulate specific proprietary noise reduction technologies.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding a delicate aura of retro magic to audio signals (default settings).
* Creating a hyped, intensified zone with increased treble energy by cranking up the Retro Vibe control.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different levels of Retro Vibe and filter settings to achieve the desired sound. Be careful not to over-process the audio.
