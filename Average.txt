A lowpass filter that averages adjacent samples in the input audio.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Taps: The number of samples to average, set to integer values for exact averaging or interpolated values for a smooth frequency response.
* Notch Frequency: Dial in unwanted high frequencies to be suppressed.
* Dry-Wet Control: Moderate the effect by blending the original audio with the filtered audio.

Best Use Cases:
Post-processing audio to moderate unwanted high frequencies and add character to the sound. Creating distinctive lowpass filter effects in music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different tap values to find the desired frequency response. Adjust notch frequencies to target specific high-frequency content for suppression.
