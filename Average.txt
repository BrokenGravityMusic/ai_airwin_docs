Average

A lowpass filter that averages adjacent audio samples, adding a unique tonality and flangey quality.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Taps: Sets the number of input audio samples to average (integer values) or interpolates between taps for a smooth blend.
	+ Range: 1-10
	+ Type: Integer/Interpolation
* Notch Frequency: Dial in unwanted high frequencies to be suppressed.
	+ Range: 1000-20000 Hz
	+ Type: Frequency control
* Dry-Wet Control: Moderates the effect, allowing you to balance the original audio with the filtered result.
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control

Caveats:

* The filter is not technically correct and introduces a cancellation node into high frequencies.

Best Use Cases:

* Post-processing audio to moderate unwanted high frequencies and add character to the sound.
* Creating distinctive lowpass filter effects in music production.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Taps values to find the desired frequency response.
* Adjust notch frequencies to target specific high-frequency content for suppression.
* Balance the Dry/Wet Control to achieve the desired blend between original and filtered audio.
