Caveats:
Be cautious with high drive settings as they can lead to unwanted clipping. Use sparingly on sensitive audio sources to avoid overpowering them.

Best Use Cases:
Adding beefy, sub-rattling elements to EDM and hip-hop tracks, enhancing kick drums with a fat, overdriven sound, or adding depth and weight to beats by applying Deckwrecka to individual drum or bass tracks rather than the entire mix.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with moderate gain settings and adjust according to your mix's requirements. Experiment with different drive settings to find the perfect balance between distortion and clarity. Use the Bass Fattener to add weight, but be careful not to overdo it as it can make the sound muddy.
