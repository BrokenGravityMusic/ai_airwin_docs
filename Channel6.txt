Channel6

Applies a simple IIR highpass, distortion using the Spiral algorithm, and slew clipping with minimal processing.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `API/Neve/SSL`: Selects the distortion model used by Channel6.
	+ API: Uses the original Density algorithm for its saturation model.
	+ Neve: Uses the Spiral algorithm for its distortion model (default).
* `Drive/Dry/Wet`: Adjusts the level of dry signal blended with the distorted signal.
	+ Drive: Controls the amount of distortion added to the signal.
	+ Wet: Controls the amount of processed signal mixed with the dry signal.
* Highpass: Applies a gentle highpass using an IIR filter, adjustable in steepness.
* Slew Clipping: Sets the slew clipping level to avoid unwanted distortion, adjustable in settings.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding subtle, analog-style sound to audio signals while preserving data integrity and minimal processing impact. Suitable for applications where a clear and pure-sounding distortion is desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different algorithm settings (API/Neve/SSL) to find the perfect fit for your sound. Adjust the highpass setting carefully to avoid over-processing your signal. Adjust the slew clipping level to maintain data integrity while applying minimal processing. Use the API, Neve, or SSL presets for calibrated amounts of shaping and distortion.
