Flutter

Simulates tape flutter as a subtle, dynamic effect, reacting to the input waveform.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Rate Control: Adjusts the rate of warbling/flopping in response to the input signal.
	+ Default value: 0.5
	+ Range: unspecified
* Flutter Algorithm Settings:
	+ Reacts directly to the input waveform, creating a regular warble with test tones
	+ Can produce aggressive flutter when pushed too far

Caveats:
May not work as intended if mis-calibrated
Can be prone to noise and awkwardness with certain inputs

Best Use Cases:
Adding subtle layering and spread to digitally flat sounds using delay or reverb sends
Destabilizing ultra-pure sounds like bells or electric pianos without tonal adjustments

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with the default rate setting (0.5) for a delicate aura of retro magic
Adjust the rate control according to your desired level of warble/flopping
Be cautious when mis-calibrating, as this can result in an intensified zone that adds treble energy
Use low latency settings for live instrument processing
