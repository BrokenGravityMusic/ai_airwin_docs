Flutter

Simulates tape flutter as a subtle, dynamic effect, reacting to the input waveform.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Rate Control: Adjusts the rate of warbling/flopping in response to the input signal.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Default value: 0.5 (adjust to bring a delicate aura of retro magic or crank it up for more treble energy)
* Flutter Algorithm Settings:
	+ Reacts directly to the input waveform, creating a regular warble with test tones
	+ Can produce aggressive flutter when pushed too far

Best Use Cases:

* Destabilizing pitch on tapelike instruments or sounds
* Adding a subtle, retro flavor to clean sounds (e.g. bells, electric pianos)
* Sneaking it onto delay or reverb sends for added layering and depth

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start with the default rate setting (0.5) for a delicate aura of retro magic
* Adjust the rate control according to your desired level of warble/flopping
* Be cautious when mis-calibrating, as this can result in an intensified zone that adds treble energy
