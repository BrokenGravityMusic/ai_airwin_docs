TapeDelay

An old school tape echo with pitch swerve effects.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay Time Control`: Adjusts the delay time of the plugin, which can produce wild pitch bends when manipulated.
	+ Range: Quarter to half second
	+ Tip: Give the plugin a quarter to half second to stabilize before adjusting settings to avoid pitch zoops.
* `Tone Shaping Control`: Affects the tone shape of the plugin using prime-numbered sample delay times, creating an averaging effect similar to convolution impulse combined with averaging.
	+ Range: (no specific range mentioned)
	+ Tip: Be careful not to reinforce artifacts when regenerating audio.
* `Prime Number Delay Time`: Enables or disables the prime-number based tone shaping delay time.

`Caveats:`

* Using this plugin on tightly trimmed audio regions may produce pitch zoops and instability if not given sufficient time to stabilize.
* Aggressive manipulation of the delay time control can result in buffer smashings/dropouts.

`Best Use Cases:`

* Creating dubby effects with a decaying tone
* Achieving a tape slapback or bright airy sound

`Tips on Optimal Settings:`

* Give the plugin sufficient time to stabilize before adjusting settings.
* Be gentle when manipulating the delay time control to avoid buffer smashings and dropouts.
