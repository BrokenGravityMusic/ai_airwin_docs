Tape Delay Simulator

A vintage tape echo with pitch swerve effects, using a technique for tone shaping that's a simplified version of Iron Oxide.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Delay Time Control`: Adjusts the delay time of the plugin, which can produce wild pitch bends when manipulated.
    + Tip: Give the plugin at least 1/4 second to stabilize before adjusting settings to avoid buffer smashings/dropouts.
* `Tone Shaping Control`: Affects the tone shape of the plugin using prime-numbered sample delay times.
    + Range: 
    + Type: A simplified version of Iron Oxide
* `Prime Number Delay Time`: Enables or disables the prime-number based tone shaping delay time.

Caveats:
* Using this plugin on tightly trimmed audio regions may produce pitch zoops and instability if not given sufficient time to stabilize.
* Aggressive manipulation of the delay time control can result in buffer smashings/dropouts.

Best Use Cases:
* Creating dubby effects with a decaying tone
* Achieving a tape slapback or bright airy sound

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Give the plugin sufficient time to stabilize before adjusting settings.
* Be gentle when manipulating the delay time control to avoid buffer smashings and dropouts.
