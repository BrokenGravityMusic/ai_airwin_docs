A super-reverb designed specifically for pads and space ambient music, capable of creating deep and expansive stereo reverberations.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet:` Mix of original audio with the reverb effect.
	+ Type: Blend control
* `Replace:` Amount of new sound coming in that replaces the existing space (0-100).
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Blend control
* `Detune:` Quadrature pitch shift for both channels, used to create maximum widening effects.
	+ Range: ±12.7%
	+ Type: Frequency shifter
* `Brightness:` Controls brightness going into and out of the reverb (±18 dB default range).
	+ Range: ±18 dB
	+ Type: Gain control

Best Use Cases:
Use for deep space ambient music, pads, and evolving ambient spaces. Also suitable for chorusing out huge synth pads or other mono sources.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
For maximum widening effects, use high Detune values. To create epic fields of reverb, set Replace to a higher value and adjust Brightness and Bigness accordingly.
