Galactic

A super-reverb designed specifically for pads and space ambient music, capable of creating deep and expansive stereo reverberations.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Replace`: Determines how much of the new sound coming in should replace the space currently in the reverb.
	+ Range: 0-100
* `Detune`: Shifts the pitch for both channels (quadraphonic pitch shift arrangement).
	+ Range: ±12.7%
	+ Type: Quadrature pitch shift
* `Brightness`: Controls brightness going into and coming out of the reverb.
	+ Range: ±18 dB
* `Bigness`: Reverb buffer size, affecting overall ambiance.
	+ Note: Adjusting Bigness can result in crashing noises.

Caveats:
* Modifying Bigness can cause crashing noises that become infinite spaces.

Best Use Cases:
* Space ambient music
* Pad synthesis and sound design

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* For pads and normal use, set Replace to a high value and adjust Brightness and Bigness accordingly.
* Use Detune to chorus out synth pads for unreasonably wide stereo fields.
