ChromeOxide

A dual-band tape emulation plugin that produces a vibey old tape sonic effect by saturating the lows and delaying the highs with a random noise warble.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Intensity: Controls the amount of noise effect used in the plugin.
	+ Range: 
* Bias: Adjusts the delay time of the highs against the lows, sculpting phase aberrations and roll-off.
	+ Range: 
* Lows Saturation: Adjusts the level of saturation in the low frequency band.
	+ Range: 
* Highs Delay: Sets the amount of delay for the high frequency band.
	+ Range: 10-20ms
* Frequency Modulation (FM): Allows for frequency modulation of the highs against the lows.
	+ Type: 

Caveats:
The plugin is not designed to produce extreme pitch wobbles or dropouts, but rather a subtle tape-like sound.

Best Use Cases:

Ideal for creating Boards of Canada-type sounds and mulch-core audio that emulates the tone of old cassette tapes. Suitable for adding a vintage vibe to tracks without overpowering them.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust the Lows Saturation to 50-70% for a warm, saturated sound.
* Set the Highs Delay to 10-20ms for a subtle delay effect.
* Experiment with different Noise Warble Bias values and Intensity settings to achieve the desired phase aberrations and roll-off flavor.
