PurestConsole2Buss

A distributed filter plugin that emulates a high-end console bus, providing a smooth and accurate representation of audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Input Level`: Adjusts the input gain of the plugin. Range: -âˆž to +6 dB.
* `Filter Type`: Selects from different filter types (e.g., Butterworth, Chebyshev) for tone shaping. Options:
	+ Range: 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
* `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
* `Drive (knob):` Add drive to the filtered signal.

Caveats:
Be cautious with high levels of drive, as it can introduce distortion.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for mixing and mastering applications where a high-end console bus emulation is desired. Suitable for use in both stereo and surround sound formats.
Use in mixing and mastering scenarios to add depth and character to tracks.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with a low cutoff frequency (around 100 Hz) for a more subtle effect.
Adjust resonance to taste, but be mindful of excessive resonance creating an unwanted "ringing" effect.
Use drive sparingly, as too much can overpower the original signal.
Adjust input level and filter type to match the specific sound you're trying to achieve.
