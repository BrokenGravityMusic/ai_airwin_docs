Audio Processing Units


* Dithers: A collection of dithering algorithms to add noise or distortion to an audio signal.
	+ Examples: Dark, PaulDither
* Dynamics: A group of compressors, expanders, and limiters for controlling the loudness and dynamics of an audio signal.
	+ Examples: Pop2, Pressure5, Dynamics
	+ Controls:
		- `Threshold:` [insert text]
			+ Range: [insert text]
			+ Type: [insert text]
		- `Ratio:` [insert text]
			+ Range: [insert text]
			+ Type: [insert text]
* Effects: A wide range of creative effects, including reverbs, delays, distortions, and more.
	+ Examples: Dubly2, GalacticVibe, Fracture2
	+ Controls:
		- `Mix:` A blend control for mixing the processed sound with the original
			+ Range: 0% to 100%
* Filter: A collection of filters, including parametric EQs, graphic EQs, and other types of filtering tools.

Caveats:


* Some units have controls with similar names but different functions. Care should be taken to understand the specific behavior of each control.
* Units may exhibit non-linear or interactive behaviors, so some settings may not behave as expected.
* Units can produce unusual sounds, so some settings may result in unappealing audio.
