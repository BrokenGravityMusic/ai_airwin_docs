A plug-in that simulates an attack-releasable gate with adjustable threshold and decay speed, allowing control over the attack strength of individual tracks. Alternatively, it can be used as a dial-an-attack effect, similar to sidechaining, but independent of tempo.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Threshold: Adjusts the level above which the gate opens or controls the sensitivity for the plugin to respond to attack.
* Swell: Controls the attack speed once the gate opens or sets the attack speed once the compressor kicks in.
* Dry/Wet: Balances the mix between the original sound and the processed sound.

Best Use Cases:

* Ideal for manipulating attack strengths of individual tracks, particularly in dance music channels strips. Can be used to turn elements into pads or vice versa.
* EDM channel strip processing
* Dance music mixing and mastering

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjusting the threshold setting can help determine the optimal balance between gate opening and closing, or finding the sweet spot for compression.
* Experiment with different swell settings to control the attack speed once the gate opens, or precisely control how quickly compressed audio recovers after being 'squished'.
* Use dry/wet controls to balance the mix between original sound and processed sound.
