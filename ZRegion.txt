ZRegion

A digital filtering plugin emulating an Emu e6400 style Airwindows Region filter. It uses cascading bandpass filter stages and distortions to create a unique sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Stages:` A series of bandpass filters that can be staggered in frequency.
	+ To adjust, simply move the controls up or down to change the filter frequencies.
* `Gain:` Allows for internal distortion when boosting gain.
	+ Use with caution as excessive gain can lead to clipping.
* `Ordering:` Adjusts the order in which the filters are applied.
	+ Experiment with different orders to achieve unique effects.
* `Filter 1-8:` Adjust the frequency range for each stage to control distortion characteristics.

Caveats:

* Excessive gain can lead to clipping and distortion.
* Improper filter ordering may result in unintended frequency responses.
* Be cautious when adjusting Filter Stage frequencies, as excessive changes can lead to unwanted effects.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating killer bass tones by setting the first filter high for midrange articulation and the last filter low for heavy bass mojo.
* Adding a unique flavor to your sound with the same characteristics as other Z filters, when used as a fixed setting.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different filter orders to achieve unique effects.
* Use gain sparingly to avoid clipping and distortion.
* For killer bass tones, set the first filter higher for midrange articulation and the last filter very low for heavy bass mojo.
* To maintain a consistent flavor as other Z filters, leave the setting as a fixed setting.
