ZRegion

A digital filtering plugin emulating an Emu e6400 style Airwindows Region filter, using cascading bandpass filter stages and distortions to create a unique sound.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Filter Stages:` A series of bandpass filters that can be staggered in frequency.
    + To adjust, simply move the controls up or down to change the filter frequencies.
* `Gain:` Allows for internal distortion when boosting gain.
    + Use with caution as excessive gain can lead to clipping.
* `Ordering:` Adjusts the order in which the filters are applied.
    + Experiment with different orders to achieve unique effects.

Caveats:
Be cautious when adjusting Filter Stage frequencies, as excessive changes can lead to unwanted effects. Excessive gain can also lead to clipping and distortion.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating killer bass tones by setting the first filter high for midrange articulation and the last filter low for heavy bass mojo.
* Adding a unique flavor to your sound with the same characteristics as other Z filters, when used as a fixed setting.
* Bass tone enhancement
* Midrange articulation shaping
* Heavy bass sound creation
