Console8LiteChannel

A simplified version of the full-featured Console8 plugin, optimized for use with a single mix bus.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Mix Bus:` Adjusts the overall gain of the plugin's output.
	+ Range: -30 dB to +6 dB
	+ Default Value: 0 dB
* Channel EQ (High/Mid/Low): 
	+ Each band has a Q value (bandwidth) that can be adjusted.
	+ High, Mid, and Low bands have separate gain controls.

Caveats:
None specified in the documentation.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for use as a simplified channel strip or mix bus processor when the full-featured Console8 plugin is not required.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Adjust the Mix Bus gain to match the average level of your tracks. Then, fine-tune the Channel EQ settings to taste, focusing on individual frequency ranges that need correction.
