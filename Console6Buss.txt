Console6Buss

Simulates a high-gain console with peak level control, designed to add intensity and depth to audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain`: Adjusts the overall gain of the simulated console.
    + Range: Not specified
    + Type: Gain
* `Peak Level`: Sets the maximum allowed signal level, useful for preventing distortion or clipping.
    + Range: 0 dB to -12 dB (recommended)
    + Type: Peak limiting

May introduce coloration or distortion if pushed too hard; be mindful of the peak level setting to avoid unwanted effects.

Ideal for adding intensity and depth to audio signals in mixing applications, particularly in situations where a more aggressive console tone is desired.

Start with moderate gain settings and adjust upwards as needed to avoid distortion.
Experiment with different character options to find the desired tone.
Pay close attention to peak level settings to prevent unwanted clipping or distortion.
