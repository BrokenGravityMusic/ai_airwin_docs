Console6Buss

Simulates a high-gain console with peak level control, designed to add intensity and depth to audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Gain`: Adjusts the overall gain of the simulated console.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `Peak Level`: Sets the maximum allowed signal level, useful for preventing distortion or clipping.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Not specified
* `Character` (from other versions): Selects from various tone-shaping options to influence the simulated console's sound.

Caveats:

* May introduce coloration or distortion if pushed too hard; be mindful of the peak level setting to avoid unwanted effects.
* Peaks at lower dB levels than other consoles, limiting the available headroom in the mix.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding intensity and depth to audio signals in mixing applications, particularly in situations where a more aggressive console tone is desired. Also suitable for creating intense, loud mixes that require maximum volume without excessive headroom.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with moderate gain settings and adjust upwards as needed to avoid distortion.
* Experiment with different character options to find the desired tone (if applicable).
* Pay close attention to peak level settings to prevent unwanted clipping or distortion.
* Set Peak Level to a moderate value (around -12 dB) and adjust Gain accordingly to achieve the desired balance.
