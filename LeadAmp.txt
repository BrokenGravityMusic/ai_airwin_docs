A bright, loud, tubey amp sim with a clear, penetrating, vocal tone.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Highpass:` Sets the high-frequency boost or cut to taste.
	+ Range: Not specified
	+ Type: Boost or cut
* `Gain Stages:` Cascading gain stages with ultrasonic filtering between them.
	+ Range: Not specified

* `Cab Simulator:` Dynamically convolved, truncated tone color. (Note: No specific range or type listed)

Caveats:
* Best suited for 96k sample rate usage.
* Ultrasonic filtering may not be optimal at lower sample rates.

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for creating clear and penetrating lead tones, especially those with a vocal or Vox-like quality.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
None recommended. However, it's suggested to tune the ultrasonic filtering to suppress aliasing even at low sample rates (if using 96k is not possible).
