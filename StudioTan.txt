StudioTan

A plugin providing three algorithms for noise floor manipulation: StudioTan (sounding like expensive studios), Dither Me Timbers (spatially enhanced and electrically charged), and Not Just Another Dither (holographic and hi-fi).

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Algorithm`: Choose from three options: StudioTan, Dither Me Timbers, or Not Just Another Dither
	+ Range: Select an algorithm to modify the tone and character of digital audio signals
* `Bit Depth`: Select either 24-bit or 16-bit output
	+ Range: Choose a bit depth for the output signal
* `Noise Shaping`: Adjust the noise shaping behavior to refine tonal results
	+ Range: Refine the tone and behavior by adjusting the noise shaping level
* `Quantization` (for StudioTan and Dither Me Timbers): Enable or disable quantization
	+ Type: Quantization setting for specific algorithms
* `Benford Realness` (for Not Just Another Dither): Enable or disable Benford Realness statistics
	+ Type: Statistics setting for specific algorithm

Caveats:

Cannot produce signal outputs beyond -1 to 1, so cannot prevent overs if mastering too hot.

Best Use Cases:

Ideal for mixing and mastering raw analog captures to lower word lengths for CD.
Use on mixes or as final dither in function if not strict definition.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

Adjust noise shaping behavior based on desired tonal results.
Experiment with different algorithms and bit depths to find the best fit for your audio material.
Pay attention to the noise floor level and adjust it according to the desired character of your audio signal.
