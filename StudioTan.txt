StudioTan

A plugin providing three algorithms for noise floor manipulation: StudioTan (sounding like expensive studios), Dither Me Timbers (spatially enhanced and electrically charged), and Not Just Another Dither (holographic and hi-fi).

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Algorithm Selection`: Choose from three options: StudioTan, Dither Me Timbers, or Not Just Another Dither.
	+ Each algorithm uses quantization, noise shaping, and Benford Realness statistics to refine tone and behavior.
* `Bit Depth`: Select either 24-bit or 16-bit output.
* `Noise Floor Adjustment`: Adjust the noise floor level for each algorithm.
* `Quantization`: Enable or disable quantization for StudioTan and Dither Me Timbers algorithms.
* `Benford Realness`: Enable or disable Benford Realness statistics for Not Just Another Dither algorithm.

Caveats:
These plugins cannot produce signal outputs beyond -1 to 1, so they cannot prevent overs if your master is excessively hot. Do not use these plugins for scientific processing or critical applications where accurate data is required. Test tones will not produce sensible results; use them at your own risk.

Best Use Cases:
* Mastering raw analog captures to lower word lengths for CD using StudioTan.
* Enhancing mixes with energy and spatiality using Dither Me Timbers.
* Creating a holographic, hi-fi sound using Not Just Another Dither.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with different bit depths and algorithm settings to find the optimal tone for your mix or master. Pay attention to the noise floor level and adjust it according to the desired character of your audio signal.
