Key Controls and Settings:


* `fpd:` Range: 0 to (2^32)-1
	+ Type: integer
* `expon:` Range: -62 to +62
	+ Type: int


Caveats:
Small truncations in noise generation can occur when used in various plugins.


Best Use Cases:
For adding some randomness to input samples, ideal for audio processing applications.


Tips on Optimal Settings:
Not applicable, as this code is designed to be efficient and fast.
