CreamCoat

A general-purpose reverb/ambience plugin that uses soft undersampling and a Bezier curve trick.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Regen:` A wide-ranging control for infinite reverbs or extremely short ambiences
	+ Adjust to achieve desired sustain or ambiance duration
* `Predelay:` A control for setting the position of short ambiences in time
	+ Adjust to place the reverb or ambiance exactly where needed
* `Sample Rate Division:` An exact divisor of the sample rate used for undersampling
	+ Set to a value that produces a smooth, lush effect without 'antique digital' artifacts

Caveats:
* Undersampling must be an exact divisor of the sample rate to avoid 'antique digital' artifacts
* High sample rates allow more finely-grained reconstruction and additional 'DeRez' options

Best Use Cases:
* General purpose reverb/ambience, especially for applications where infinite sustain or short ambiences are needed

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Adjust `Regen` to balance between infinite sustain and short ambiences
* Experiment with `Predelay` to find optimal placement for short ambiences
* Use a suitable sample rate division value to achieve the desired effect without artifacts
