CreamCoat

A general-purpose reverb/ambience plugin that uses soft undersampling to produce a smooth, lush effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Undersample Factor:` controls the level of undersampling
	+ Range: exact divisor of sample rate (to avoid 'antique digital' artifacts)
	+ Type: select an exact divisor for optimal results
* `Regen:` wide-ranging control for infinite reverbs or extremely short ambiences
	+ Range: adjust to achieve desired sustain or ambiance duration
	+ Type: control infinite sustain and regeneration across various settings
* `Predelay:` sets the delay time for short ambiences
	+ Range: adjust to place the reverb or ambiance exactly where needed
	+ Type: control the position of short ambiences in time

Best Use Cases:
General-purpose reverb/ambience plugin, ideal for applications where infinite sustain or short ambiences are needed.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Experiment with `Regen` and `Predelay` controls to balance between infinite sustain and short ambiences. Adjust `Undersample Factor` to achieve desired level of oversampling or undersampling.
