A filter that takes the tiny microdetails in the sampling theorem and makes them darker and deeper.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Noise Shaping`: A gentler noise shaping than other dithers.
* `Latency`: Runs one sample of latency (output stage)
* `Rounding Method`: For every sample, the plugin asks whether it's larger or smaller than its surroundings. If it's the top of a corner or a spike of treble, it simply picks whichever 'rounding' will smooth out the treble the most.

Caveats:
This plugin is a filter, not a traditional dither. It may not be suitable for all types of music or audio content. The plugin is a filter that takes the most delicate subtleties of the digital waveform and darkens them up, on purpose.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating depth and distance in ambient sounds
* Making natural organic tones feel solid and real
* Adding body to quiet musical notes

Tips on Optimal Settings:
To get the best results, use this plugin on 24-bit audio and adjust the noise shaping to suit your desired sound. Experiment with different settings to find the right balance of darkness and depth for your music.
