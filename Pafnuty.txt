Adds harmonics to audio signals using a Chebyshev filter, generating sine waves at frequencies twice, three, four times, up to thirteenth harmonic.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Harmonic multipliers (up to 13th harmonic)
    + Adjust the level of each harmonic frequency
    + Range: 
    + Type: 
* Attenuverter (dry-wet control with inverse-dry-wet):
    + Blend original audio with enhanced signal
    + Range: 
    + Type: 

Caveats:
* Harmonic addition can result in aliasing if input frequencies exceed the sampling rate
* Be cautious when adding high-order harmonics, as they may introduce audible artifacts

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding coloration and enhancement to audio signals, particularly in situations where subtle harmonic additions are desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
* Start with low harmonic orders (e.g., 2nd or 3rd) and adjust levels carefully
* Monitor the output for aliasing and adjust settings as needed
