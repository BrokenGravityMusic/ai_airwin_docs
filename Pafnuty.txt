Pafnuty

Adds harmonics to audio signals using a Chebyshev filter, generating sine waves at frequencies twice, three, four times, up to thirteenth harmonic.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Harmonic multipliers (up to 13th harmonic)
	+ Range: Adjust the level of each harmonic frequency
	+ Type: Sliders that move to the right to add harmonics, left to subtract
* Attenuverter (dry-wet control with inverse-dry-wet):
	+ Range: Blend original audio with enhanced signal
	+ Type: Control ratio of dry and wet signals

Caveats:
* Harmonic addition can result in aliasing if input frequencies exceed the sampling rate
* Pafnuty resists adding extra harmonics, helping to reduce aliasing
* Be cautious when adding high-order harmonics, as they may introduce audible artifacts

Best Use Cases:
Ideal for adding coloration and enhancement to audio signals, particularly in situations where subtle harmonic additions are desired.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Start with low harmonic orders (e.g., 2nd or 3rd) and adjust levels carefully
Monitor the output for aliasing and adjust settings as needed
Use attenuverter to blend original signal with enhanced audio, adjusting ratio to taste
