Using high levels of Remap can lead to an over-the-top effect, requiring careful adjustment of the Dry/Wet control and output level.
Find the focus point of the Remap level control by turning up the control until it becomes too much, then back it off to a more balanced setting.
Use output level and dry/wet controls to balance the remapped signal with the original audio.
