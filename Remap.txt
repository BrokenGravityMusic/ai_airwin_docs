Remap

An algorithm that heightens the peak energy and pointiness of audio signals, making them more impactful and engaging.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Dry/Wet Control`: Adjusts the balance between the original audio signal and the remapped signal.
	+ Turning up the Dry/Wet control adds more emphasis to the remapped signal, creating a fiercer crunchy punchiness.
	+ Turning it down blends the original signal back in, maintaining a subtle effect.
* `Remap Slider`: Controls the amount of re-mapping applied to the audio signal.
	+ Values below 0.5 result in a very subtle effect, while values above 0.5 can create dramatic changes.
* `Level Control`: Adjusts the overall gain of the processed signal.

Caveats:
Be cautious when using high levels of Remap, as it can introduce unwanted artifacts and distortion.
Using high values of the Remap slider can lead to an over-the-top effect, requiring careful adjustment of the Dry/Wet control.
Remap produces peaks above 0dB on full-scale content, so be warned: it's basically putting the dynamics back.

Best Use Cases:
Use Remap to add punch and energy to mixes that feel flat or congested.
Apply Remap to individual tracks (e.g., drums, guitars, vocals) to bring out their natural tone and character.

Tips on Optimal Settings:
Find the focus point of the Remap slider by turning up the control until it becomes too much, then back it off to a more balanced setting.
Use output level and dry/wet controls to balance the remapped signal with the original audio.
