TremoSquare

A squarewave tremolo effect that only switches on zero crossings, producing a warm and smooth tremolo sound with a unique "de-rezzing" effect when frequency is ramped up.

Key Controls and Settings:

* Dry/Wet Control: A slider to blend the dry signal (original audio) with the wet signal (tremolo effect).
	+ Range: [Insert text]
* Frequency Range: Adjustable range of frequencies that the tremolo effect will affect.
	+ Range: Extremely large, allowing for a wide range of effects
* Zero Crossing Transition: The plugin only transitions from silent to full volume on zero crossings, giving a smooth and warm sound.

Caveats:

* Does not tempo sync.
* Ramping up frequency too high can cause the "de-rezzing" effect, which may be undesirable in some situations.
* Transitions become indistinguishable at high frequencies due to zero-crossing interference.

Best Use Cases:

* Adding a unique and warm tremolo effect to bassy sounds or other instruments.
* Creating a distinct "de-rezzing" effect by ramping up frequency.
* Using as a mix-blender effect to add texture and interest to audio mixes.
* Adding warmth and texture to aggressive signals, especially on bassy sounds.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Adjust the dry/wet control to balance the amount of tremolo effect with the original audio.
* Experiment with different frequency ranges to find the desired effect.
* Use sparingly when ramping up frequency to avoid undesirable "de-rezzing" effects.
* Ramp up the frequency of the tremolo effect super high to create the 'de-rezzing' effect.
