TremoSquare

A squarewave tremolo effect that only switches on zero crossings, producing a warm and smooth tremolo sound with a unique "de-rezzing" effect when frequency is ramped up.

* `Dry/Wet Control:` A slider to blend the dry signal (original audio) with the wet signal (tremolo effect).
    + Range: [insert text]
* `Frequency Range:` Adjustable range of frequencies that the tremolo effect will affect.
    + Range: Extremely large, allowing for a wide range of effects
* `Zero Crossing Transition:` The plugin only transitions from silent to full volume on zero crossings, giving a smooth and warm sound.

The plugin does not tempo sync. Ramping up frequency too high can cause the "de-rezzing" effect, which may be undesirable in some situations.

Adding a unique and warm tremolo effect to bassy sounds or other instruments. Creating a distinct "de-rezzing" effect by ramping up frequency. Using as a mix-blender effect to add texture and interest to audio mixes.

Adjust the dry/wet control to balance the amount of tremolo effect with the original audio. Experiment with different frequency ranges to find the desired effect. Use sparingly when ramping up frequency to avoid undesirable "de-rezzing" effects.
