GalacticVibe

A stereo vibrato plugin producing quadrature modulated outputs, creating a chorus-like effect.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Input`: Audio input to process.
* `Dry/Wet Control`: Blends the modulated sound with the original audio.
* `Speed`: Adjusts the speed of the vibrato modulation (range: varies).
* `Depth`: Controls the amount of vibrato applied to each channel.
* `Mode/Type`: Not specified, but presumably a simple on/off switch.

Caveats:
None specified.

Best Use Cases:

* Creating a chorus-like effect with a unique, organic quality.
* Adding slow swirly effects to audio signals.
* Ramping up speed for a striking "Leslie, but not Leslie" quality.
* Enhancing stereo imaging with subtle pitch modulation.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Experiment with different Speed and Depth settings to achieve the desired vibrato effect.
* Adjusting Dry/Wet control can help balance between chorus-like effect and original sound.
* For a more dramatic effect, increase the quadrature modulation speed or boost the depth.
* To achieve a smoother sound, reduce the quadrature modulation speed or decrease the depth.
