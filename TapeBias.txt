TapeBias

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bias Level:` Adjusts the amount of bias applied (0-1 range).
    + Range: 0% to 100%
* `Type:` Selects between underbiasing or overbiasing.
    + Type: Toggle for Underbias or Overbias modes
* `Slew Rate:` Adjusts the rate at which the bias frequency is introduced into the signal.

Caveats:

* Bypassed at 0.5 to save CPU.
* Overbiasing can eat up headroom, potentially leading to clipping of high frequencies.
* Underbiasing can introduce a brighter, drier sound quality.

Best Use Cases:

* Recording high-frequency content.
* Creating sounds that mimic tape machine artifacts.
* Designing specific sonic effects for sound design purposes.
* Sound design and experimentation with tape effects.
* Isolating the bias effect for use in VCV Rack or other applications.

Tips on Optimal Settings:

* Start with moderate settings (e.g., Bias = -2, Type = Overbias) to avoid excessive headroom consumption.
* Adjust Slew Rate to control the rate at which the bias frequency is introduced.
* Experiment with different settings to achieve desired tape-like effects.
