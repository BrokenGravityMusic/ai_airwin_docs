TapeBias

A plugin allowing you to underbias or overbias audio signals.

Key Controls and Settings:

* `Bias Level:` Adjusts the amount of bias applied (0-1 range).
	+ Range: 0% to 100%
	+ Type: Linear
* `Type:` Selects between underbiasing or overbiasing.
	+ Options: Under, Over
* `Frequency:` Sets the frequency of the bias tone (default: 40k Hz).
	+ Range: [insert text]

Caveats:
Bypassed at 0.5, perfect bias means no processing is applied. Overbiasing eats up headroom and can lead to clipping if too intense.

Best Use Cases:
Recording high-frequency content.
Creating sounds that mimic tape machine artifacts.
Designing specific sonic effects for sound design purposes.

Tips on Optimal Settings: Adjust bias level and type based on desired effect. Be mindful of headroom when overbiasing.
